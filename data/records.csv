10192404,Should we consider mood disturbance in schizophrenia as an important determinant of quality of life?,"The main objective in the treatment of schizophrenia should be to optimize individual patient functioning and quality of life. Little is known about the possible relationship of concurrent mood symptoms and quality of life. We hypothesized that the quality of life for people with schizophrenia would be inversely related to the severity of concurrent mood disruption. We conducted a post hoc analysis of an international, multicenter, double-blind, 28-week study of 339 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder and were randomized to treatment with either olanzapine or risperidone. Quality of life data were collected at baseline, 8, 16, 24, and 28 weeks or at early discontinuation; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) data were collected at each visit (weekly to week 8 and monthly thereafter). Correlations were calculated between changes in quality of life (quality of life scale [QLS] total and subscales) and PANSS mood score. Regression models were used to determine the proportion of variability in the QLS total and subscores accounted for by changes in PANSS positive, PANSS negative, and PANSS mood scores. Finally, path analysis was performed to determine the mechanisms used by the PANSS mood scores to affect the QLS total and subscores. Olanzapine demonstrated a significantly greater therapeutic effect on the PANSS mood item than risperidone did. However, mood improvements with either therapy demonstrated correlations of PANSS mood on the QLS total and subscores which were statistically significant, with the strongest correlation against the interpersonal relations (QLS-IPR) subscore. The path analysis results indicate that the PANSS mood item's most significant path in affecting the QLS total and QLS-IPR is direct. Changes in the quality of life of schizophrenic patients is inversely related to changes in the concurrent mood disruption. Early therapeutic interventions directed at a broader constellation of schizophrenic symptomatology, including mood, may be helpful in improving an individual patient's quality of life.

Ninety-three patients participated at 9 South African sites; their data are reported here. There was a significant drug effect on both the CGI Global Improvement score and the LSAS at 12 weeks. In addition, there was no significant difference in overall rate of adverse experiences between those on paroxetine and those on placebo.

This paper describes the results of the first placebo-controlled comparison of the efficacy, safety, and effects on sexual functioning of sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. This randomized, double-masked, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter trial enrolled 360 patients with moderate-to-severe recurrent major depression. Patients were treated with bupropion SR 150 to 400 mg/d, sertraline 50 to 200 mg/d, or placebo for up to 8 weeks. Patients' depression and sexual functioning were assessed at weekly or biweekly clinic visits; safety was assessed by regular monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, and body weight. Treatment groups were similar at baseline in terms of age, sex, and race, and most patients had a diagnosis of moderate uncomplicated depression. Patients treated with bupropion SR or sertraline showed similar improvements on all efficacy measures; both active treatments were superior to placebo in improving scores on all rating scales for depression at various time points.

A 6-week, double-blind randomized multicenter trial, with a long-term extension, was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and QOL of olanzapine and haloperidol in treating schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. A total of 828 outpatients provided QOL data.

10572324,A double-blind comparison of sertraline and fluoxetine in the treatment of major depressive episode in outpatients.,"Depression is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. As depressive disorders carry a high risk of relapse, treatment strategies include the use of a 6-month continuation period after resolution of the acute episode. Tolerability is of major importance when determining compliance and outcome during long-term therapy.

Comparative studies have not shown differences between the SSRIs in terms of efficacy, but side-effect profiles may vary. A multicenter, double-blind, comparative study of sertraline and fluoxetine was carried out in outpatients fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder. Patients were randomised to receive sertraline (50-150 mg, n = 118) or fluoxetine (20-60 mg, n = 120) for 24 weeks. Assessments for depression (HAM-D, HAD, CGI-I, CGI-S), anxiety (Covi), sleep (Leeds Sleep Evaluation scale) and quality of life (SIP) were made at study entry and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24.

The primary efficacy outcome measures were the final ratings on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21) total score, HAM-D21 depressed mood item, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score, and Clinical Global Impressions Scale. Withdrawal from the study due to adverse events occurred in 6% of the patients in the venlafaxine XR group and 9% of the patients in the fluoxetine group. Patients treated with venlafaxine XR, but only rarely those treated with fluoxetine, had statistically significant improvements in their depression ratings compared with placebo at the end of the study. The percentages of patients who achieved full remission of their depression (HAM-D21 total score < or = 7) at the end of treatment were 37%, 22% and 18% for the venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine and placebo groups, respectively. The differences in remission rates between venlafaxine XR and the other groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The superior remission outcome observed with venlafaxine XR treatment needs to be replicated in additional studies. Venlafaxine XR is a well-tolerated and efficacious treatment for depression. The results of this study suggest that venlafaxine XR is as well-tolerated as fluoxetine but may have some efficacy advantages over fluoxetine.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.,"This study compares the effect of clozapine and haloperidol and identifies other factors related to family burden as experienced by relatives of patients with refractory schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). Of 423 patients participating in a multisite randomized clinical trial, 221 identified a family member who was actively involved in their care and who agreed to complete a standardized measure of family burden at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization, simultaneous with comprehensive patient assessments. Patient factors most consistently correlated with greater family burden were symptom severity, days living in the community (i.e., not in the hospital), and frequency of family contact. Among family members, clozapine was associated with significantly (p = .048) greater reduction in feelings of dissatisfaction related to providing support to the patient, but not in objective measures of support, amount of worry the patient engendered, or days of missed employment or household activity. Although clozapine reduces symptoms, thus lowering family burden, it also increases days living in the community, which tends to increase family burden, perhaps canceling out the benefit to families of reduced symptoms. Clozapine has a small but significant effect on the experience of families of patients.

Such a strategy might also be effective for improving medication compliance and the outcome of continuation treatment. The safety and effectiveness of a new formulation of enteric-coated fluoxetine (90 mg) given once weekly was tested during the continuation treatment of major depressive disorder. Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with modified 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) scores > or = 18 and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) scores > or = 4 were treated 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day of fluoxetine in a multicenter U.S. study. Responders (N = 501) were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg of enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. The primary efficacy measure was the percentage of patients who relapsed. Time to relapse was tested over the 25-week continuation period using log-rank analyses of the Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse rates. Additional analyses of efficacy included comparison of change from baseline to endpoint for the HAM-D-17, CGI-S, and HAM-D-28 subscales by last observation carried forward (LOCF). Safety measures included comparison of treatment-emergent adverse events, both spontaneous and solicited (using the Association for Methodology of Documentation in Psychiatry-Module 5), vital signs, and laboratory measures. Relapse rates for patients assigned to fluoxetine, either 20 mg daily or 90 mg weekly, were significantly lower than for placebo by log-rank analysis and LOCF analyses of secondary efficacy measures. Efficacy did not significantly differ between the 2 active drug groups by these measures.

A secondary objective was to discriminate those items predicting the response to an agent according to its serotoninergic or noradrenergic pharmacologic profile. The tool used for this latter purpose was the Aubin-Jouvent-Rating-Scale (AJRS) which was designed to assess the deficit of serotonin: this is a scale with 10 items, some of them regrouped into a ""general"" factor (irritability, sudden mood change, impatience, aggressivity) or a ""depression"" factor (pain, anxiety, suicidal ideas) with additional items related to sleep disorders, abnormalities in eating behavior and inability to tolerate isolation. In the perspective of this assessment, paroxetine was chosen due to its potential to inhibit serotonin re-uptake, as compared to mianserin which blocks presynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors with negligible action on serotonin. This was a multicenter study carried out in France in 50 hospital or private practice psychiatrists. The assessment criteria included the MADRS, the AJRS, the COVI's anxiety scale, the Folstein's Mini-mental state (MMS) as well as a global assessment by the investigator at the end of the study. Safety was measured with a nondirective questionnaire, routine laboratory tests as well as a global assessment by the investigator. The primary efficacy criteria was the change in the MADRS global score. Statistical analysis included chi-square or Fisher's test as well as Student's and Wilcoxon tests for comparability at baseline, and analysis of variance for the changes in scores as during the study. A total of 116 patients was randomised (paroxetine: 54; mianserine: 62), of whom 96 completed the study (paroxetine: 43; mianserine: 53). With the exception of MADRS moderately higher in the paroxetine group, both groups were comparable at baseline. After 6 weeks of treatment, a marked improvement was recorded in both groups for all criteria except MMS; there was a consistent tendency favouring paroxetine which reached statistical significance for the COVI' scale (p = 0.001). For a given criterion, the difference paroxetine versus mianserine appeared related to the score at baseline; it was also more marked in those patients with a AJRS baseline score > or = 20 with a difference for MADRS reduction of marginal significance in favor of paroxetine (p = 0.061). As regards safety, at least one adverse event was reported in 31.5% of the patients receiving paroxetine versus 41.9% in those receiving mianserin (NS); premature withdrawal related to an adverse event was reported in 11.1% of the patients in the paroxetine group versus 12.9% in the mianserin group. No abnormality of clinical significance was reported in either group concerning laboratory tests. In conclusion, this study confirmed the therapeutic value and good safety of paroxetine as an antidepressant in geriatric populations, especially when exist a concomitant anxiety or symptoms likely to reflect a deficit of serotonine (irritability, emotional lability, restlessness, aggressivity) and to predict a good response to an agent such as this one.",L'Encephale,2001,,success,2000,2001,L'Encephale,"[Comparative study of paroxetine and mianserin in depression in elderly patients: efficacy, tolerance, serotonin dependence].","The primary objective of this multicentre, randomized, double-blind study carried out in France was to compare the efficacy and safety of a 6-week treatment with paroxetine (20 mg/day) or mianserine (30 mg/day) in geriatric hospitalized or ambulatory patients (> or = 60 years) treated for a major depressive disorder (according to DSM III-R).

The primary analyses included: (i) a test of non-inferiority of olanzapine compared with haloperidol in efficacy using the Final Global Improvement Rating (FGIR); and (ii) comparison between the treatment groups in extrapyramidal symptom severity using the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). Olanzapine was comparable to haloperidol in efficacy in treating positive symptoms and significantly superior in treating negative symptoms. Extrapyramidal symptom severity was significantly improved for olanzapine-treated patients versus haloperidol-treated patients. Olanzapine was shown to be more effective and better tolerated than haloperidol in the treatment of Japanese patients suffering from chronic schizophrenia.",False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,compliant

Data from 3 placebo-controlled multicenter trials of paroxetine in DSM-IV social anxiety disorder (N = 829) were analyzed using logistic regression to determine predictors of response. Demographic (age, sex), physiologic (baseline heart rate, baseline mean arterial pressure), clinical (baseline social anxiety symptom severity, baseline disability, duration of illness), and trial variables (paroxetine dose, treatment duration) were included. Only duration of treatment was a statistically significant predictor of treatment response. Further analysis demonstrated that, in paroxetine-treated patients in particular, many nonresponders at week 8 (46/166; 27.7%) were responders at week 12. These data demonstrate that paroxetine is a reasonable choice of treatment in a broad spectrum of patients with social anxiety disorder. An optimal trial of medication should continue beyond 8 weeks.",False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,compliant
11879161,Double-blind switch study of imipramine or sertraline treatment of antidepressant-resistant chronic depression.,"Although various strategies have been proposed to treat antidepressant nonresponders, little controlled research has been published that examines prospectively the use of switching to an alternate antidepressant. This was a multisite study in which outpatients with chronic major depression (with or without concurrent dysthymia), who failed to respond to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either sertraline hydrochloride (n = 117) or imipramine hydrochloride (n = 51), were crossed over or switched to 12 additional weeks of double-blind treatment with the alternate medication. Outcome measures included the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Clinical Global Impressions--Severity and Improvement scales. The switch from sertraline to imipramine (mean dosage, 221 mg/d) and from imipramine to sertraline (mean dosage, 163 mg/d) resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements. The switch to sertraline treatment was associated with fewer adverse effect complaints and significantly less attrition owing to adverse effects. Although sertraline treatment also resulted in significantly higher response rates in the intent-to-treat samples (60% in the sertraline group and 44% in the imipramine group), neither the intent-to-treat remission rates nor the response and remission rates among study completers differed significantly. Moreover, after considering the effect of attrition, there were no significant treatment effects on the more comprehensive generalized estimating equation analyses of the continuous dependent measures. More than 50% of chronically depressed antidepressant nonresponders benefited from a switch from imipramine to sertraline, or vice versa, despite a high degree of chronicity. As in the initial trial, sertraline was generally better tolerated than imipramine.

12097783,Treatment approaches to major depressive disorder relapse. Part 1: dose increase.,"Although continuing antidepressant treatment after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, this risk is not eliminated. A number of theories have been proposed to account for this apparent loss of efficacy. A common initial approach to managing relapse is to increase the dose of antidepressant. We prospectively evaluated the likelihood of response to increasing the fluoxetine doses in patients relapsing during a long-term efficacy study of two fluoxetine dosing regimens. Patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder with modified HAMD17 scores > or =18 and CGI-severity scores > or =4 were treated for 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine in a multicenter US study. Responders (n = 501) were randomized to 20 mg fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. If the patients relapsed during the continuation phase, they were offered a 25-week optional rescue treatment phase during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day reinitiated, (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week. The results of the rescue phase for the latter two groups who relapsed while on continuation treatment with fluoxetine are reported. Response was defined as a 50% reduction in the modified HAMD17 score since time of relapse and a CGI-severity score < or =2. Additional efficacy analyses included HAMD and CGI-severity changes from baseline to endpoint. Safety measures included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the enteric-coated 90-mg-twice-weekly group). Mean modified HAMD17 scores decreased from a mean of approximately 20 to below 8 and were maintained for up to 6 months in the responders. Thirty-five percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after augmentation of medication. The patients relapsing after initially responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. These results also generally support increasing dose as a first-line treatment strategy for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. Increasing enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appeared to be as well-tolerated and effective in restoring response as increasing a daily fluoxetine dose from 20 to 40 mg.",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,2002,,noncompliant,2000,2002,Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,Treatment approaches to major depressive disorder relapse.

Part 2: reinitiation of antidepressant treatment.,"Anecdotal reports concerning mood disorder patients suggest restarting drug treatment in patients who prematurely discontinue it may be associated with a diminished chance of response upon rechallenge. We evaluated the likelihood of response to reinitiation of fluoxetine treatment in patients relapsing after switching to placebo during a long-term efficacy study of two different dosing regimens of fluoxetine. Patients who met the DSM-IV major depressive disorder criteria with modified HAMD17 scores > or =18 and CGI-Severity scores > or =4 were treated with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine for 13 weeks in a multicenter US study. Responders (n = 501) were randomized to placebo, 20 mg fluoxetine daily, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. Patients relapsing during the continuation phase were offered 25 weeks of double-blind rescue treatment during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/ day reinitiated; (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week. Only the results of the rescue phase for the group who relapsed while on continuation treatment with placebo are reported here. Analyses included percentage of responders (50% reduction of modified HAMD17 and CGI-Severity < or =2) and assessments of change from baseline to endpoint (HAMD, CGI-Severity). Safety measures included assessment of vital signs, laboratory measures, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Of 122 patients assigned to placebo, 57 (47%) relapsed during continuation treatment. Fifty-five (96%) of these elected to enter double-blind rescue treatment. Overall, patients who relapsed upon switching to placebo responded well to reinitiation of fluoxetine (62%). The mean modified HAMD17 score decreased from 20 to less than 9 and was maintained for up to 6 months. Thirty-eight percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after reinitiation of medication. This study suggests that patients who, after an initial response to fluoxetine, relapse upon switching to placebo have a relatively high probability of responding to the reinitiation of fluoxetine treatment. These results challenge the view that the efficacy of an agent prematurely discontinued is diminished when such an agent is restarted. They also generally support reinitiation of the same antidepressant as a 'first-line' treatment strategy in patients who relapsed after stopping a previously effective antidepressant.",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,2002,,noncompliant,2000,2002,Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,Treatment approaches to major depressive disorder relapse.

Asian inpatients and outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (N = 108) currently treated with predominantly typical antipsychotics were switched to olanzapine (initial dose of 10 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the direct switch group (N = 54) received only olanzapine, while the start-taper switch group (N = 54) received olanzapine and their usual antipsychotic in decreasing doses for the first 2 weeks. A successful switch was defined as completing 6 weeks of therapy without worsening of symptoms (Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale [CGI-S]) or extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson-Angus Scale).

12151468,Risperidone in children with autism and serious behavioral problems.,"Atypical antipsychotic agents, which block postsynaptic dopamine and serotonin receptors, have advantages over traditional antipsychotic medications in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and may be beneficial in children with autistic disorder who have serious behavioral disturbances. However, data on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited. We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement (CGI-I) scale at eight weeks. A total of 101 children (82 boys and 19 girls; mean [+/-SD] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (49 children) or placebo (52).

The effects of different AMI doses on five different symptom dimensions of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were analyzed. Results on global efficacy and safety parameters have been previously published. Four AMI doses (100 mg/day [AMI100], 400 mg/day [AMI400], 800 mg/day [AMI800], 1200 mg/day) were compared with 16 mg haloperidol (HAL16) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 4-week trial.

Response on BPRS factors defined as > or = 40% improvement and ORs were computed. An optimal AMI dose was calculated for each BPRS factor based on linear and quadratic regression. For all BPRS factors, inverted u-shaped dose-response curves emerged (r2 > 95%). The estimated AMI dose optimum for the BPRS factors activation/ agitation (760 mg), thought disturbances (716 mg), and hostility/suspiciousness (694 mg) was higher than that for anergia/negative symptoms (584 mg) and depression/anxiety (672 mg).

To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral aripiprazole monotherapy. Patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments included PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores. Safety assessments included: adverse events (AEs) recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups, and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration in EPS occurred in any group.

Patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments included PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores. Safety assessments included: adverse events (AEs) recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups, and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration in EPS occurred in any group. The reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups. Any of the three strategies evaluated can be used safely for switching patients to aripiprazole from antipsychotic monotherapy. Furthermore, patients' symptoms may continue to improve after switching to aripiprazole.",False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,compliant

Few studies have prospectively examined the effects of the prior medication or switching method on the safety and efficacy of a newly available antipsychotic. Efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone were evaluated in patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were switched from conventional or atypical antipsychotics in three 6-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trials. Stable outpatients with persistent symptoms or troublesome side effects on (1) conventional antipsychotic (N = 108), (2) olanzapine (N = 104), or (3) risperidone (N = 58) therapy were switched to an open-label, 6-week, flexible-dose trial of ziprasidone (40-160 mg/day).

This study followed 980 patients at high risk for suicide in a multicenter prospective study for 2 years after randomization to clozapine or olanzapine. A priori predictors related to diagnosis, treatment resistance, and clinical constructs of disease symptoms were evaluated as possible predictors of subsequent suicide-related events. Ten baseline univariate predictors were identified. Historical predictors were diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, history or current use at baseline of alcohol or substance abuse, cigarette smoking, number of lifetime suicide attempts, and the number of hospitalizations in the previous 36 months to prevent suicide. Predictive clinical features included greater baseline scores on the InterSePT scale for suicidal thinking, the Covi Anxiety Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS), and severity of Parkinsonism. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed the number of hospitalizations in the previous 36 months, baseline CDS, severity of Parkinson's, history of substance abuse, and lifetime suicide attempts. Clozapine, in general, was more effective than olanzapine in decreasing the risk of suicidality, regardless of risk factors present.

The main outcome measures were changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores and rates of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Subjects were 175 patients age 60 years or over with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The mean duration of illness was 36.5 years. Median doses were 2 mg/day of risperidone and 10 mg/day of olanzapine. PANSS total scores and four of the five PANSS factor scores (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, and anxiety/depression) improved significantly at all time-points and at endpoint in both groups; between-treatment differences were not significant. EPS-related adverse events were reported by 9.2% of patients in the risperidone group and 15.9% in the olanzapine group; the between-treatment difference was not significant.

14628982,Efficacy of controlled-release paroxetine in the treatment of late-life depression.,"Depression is the second most common neuropsychiatric disorder in older Americans, with significant clinical and public health costs. Despite advances in treatment, late-life depression remains a clinical challenge. Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most common pharmacologic intervention for late-life depression, few placebo-controlled trials have assessed the efficacy of SSRIs for this condition. In this 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, double-blind, randomized trial, 319 elderly patients (mean age = 70 years) were treated with controlled-release paroxetine (paroxetine CR) up to 50 mg/day (N = 104), immediate-release paroxetine (paroxetine IR) up to 40 mg/day (N = 106), or placebo (N = 109). Patients met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and had a total score of 18 or more on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to endpoint in HAM-D total score. The primary efficacy analysis showed an adjusted difference between change from baseline in HAM-D score for paroxetine CR and placebo of -2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.47 to -0.73, p = .007) at the week 12 last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) endpoint. The adjusted difference between paroxetine IR and placebo was -2.8 (95% CI = -4.65 to -0.99, p = .003) at week 12.

The study involved 262 patients (of 263 who were randomized and who returned for a post-randomization evaluation) within their first episode of psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder) recruited from 14 academic medical centers in North America and Western Europe. Patients with a history of substance dependence within 1 month prior to entry were excluded. Of this sample, 97 (37%) had a lifetime diagnosis of substance use disorder (SUD); of these 74 (28% of the total) had a lifetime cannabis use disorder (CUD) and 54 (21%) had a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Patients with SUD were more likely to be men. Those with CUD had a lower age of onset than those without. Patients with SUD had more positive symptoms and fewer negative symptoms than those without SUD, and they had a longer duration of untreated psychosis. The 12-week response data indicated that 27% of patients with SUD were responders compared to 35% of those without SUD. Patients with AUD were less likely to respond to olanzapine than those without AUD.

This study is designed to evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness of four treatments for adolescents with major depressive disorder: fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, their combination, and, acutely, pill placebo. This report describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample and addresses external validity. Participants are 439 adolescents, aged 12-17 years inclusively, with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of current major depressive disorder. Baseline data are summarized and compared with those from national samples and previous trials. The sample composition is 54.4% girls, 73.8% white, 12.5% African American, and 8.9% Hispanic. The mean Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised total score is 60.1 (SD = 10.4, range 45-98) with 86.0% experiencing their first major depressive episode.

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 10-20 mg/day of olanzapine or 80-160 mg/day of ziprasidone. The primary efficacy measure was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score. Secondary efficacy and safety measures included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale subscales as well as mood, quality of life, and extrapyramidal symptom scales. Safety was evaluated by recording treatment-emergent adverse events and measuring vital signs and weight. The study was completed by significantly more olanzapine-treated patients (165 of 277, 59.6%) than ziprasidone-treated patients (115 of 271, 42.4%). At 28 weeks, the olanzapine-treated patients showed significantly more improvement than the ziprasidone-treated patients on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale overall scale and all subscales and on the Clinical Global Impression ratings of severity of illness and improvement. The responder rate was higher for olanzapine than for ziprasidone. Extrapyramidal symptoms were not significantly different between groups in change-to-endpoint analyses, but results favored olanzapine on baseline-to-maximum changes.

This was a multicenter randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 28-week study of patients with schizophrenia. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 10-20 mg/day of olanzapine or 80-160 mg/day of ziprasidone. The primary efficacy measure was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score. Secondary efficacy and safety measures included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale subscales as well as mood, quality of life, and extrapyramidal symptom scales. Safety was evaluated by recording treatment-emergent adverse events and measuring vital signs and weight. The study was completed by significantly more olanzapine-treated patients (165 of 277, 59.6%) than ziprasidone-treated patients (115 of 271, 42.4%). At 28 weeks, the olanzapine-treated patients showed significantly more improvement than the ziprasidone-treated patients on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale overall scale and all subscales and on the Clinical Global Impression ratings of severity of illness and improvement. The responder rate was higher for olanzapine than for ziprasidone. Extrapyramidal symptoms were not significantly different between groups in change-to-endpoint analyses, but results favored olanzapine on baseline-to-maximum changes.

Baseline data on more than 1,400 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were collected before their entry into the CATIE study. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between participation in either competitive employment or other vocational activities and sociodemographic characteristics, schizophrenia symptoms, neurocognitive functioning, intrapsychic functioning, availability of psychosocial rehabilitation services, and local unemployment rates. Altogether, 14.5% of the patients reported participating in competitive employment in the month before the baseline assessment, 12.6% reported other (noncompetitive) employment activity, and 72.9% reported no employment activity. Participation in either competitive or noncompetitive employment was associated with having less severe symptoms, better neurocognitive functioning, and higher scores on a measure of intrapsychic functioning that encompassed motivation, empathy, and other psychological characteristics. Competitive employment, in contrast to other employment or no employment, was negatively associated with receipt of disability payments as well as with being black.

Primary efficacy was assessed by change from baseline in score on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the secondary outcome measure was change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) score. Mean changes in the total HAM-D and CGI-S scores from baseline to 6-week endpoint for the paroxetine and desipramine groups were not significantly different than those for the placebo-treated group. An unusually high rate of response (defined as >or=50% improvement in the HAM-D score) in the placebo group was observed (55% [N=6]); adverse events precipitated patient discontinuation in the active treatment groups (9% [N=1] for desipramine, 15% [N=2] for paroxetine) similar to that in the placebo-treated patients (18% [N=2]). Improvement on symptom dimensions within the HAM-D and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (depressive, anxiety, cognitive, neurovegetative, or somatic) was also similar between groups. The small number of women in this study most likely contributed to the lack of observed differences in efficacy observed during the 6 weeks of treatment.

16607468,Pramipexole versus sertraline in the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease: a national multicenter parallel-group randomized study.,"In addition to treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the dopamine agonist pramipexole has shown an antidepressant effect. The trials, however, included patients with motor complications, raising the question of whether the antidepressant benefit represented only a treatment-related motor improvement. To address this issue, we have conducted a 14-week randomized trial comparing pramipexole with an established antidepressant in patients without motor complications. At seven Italian centers, 67 Parkinsonian outpatients with major depression but no history of motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia received open-label pramipexole (at 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day) or sertraline (at 50 mg/day).

16702898,Early predictors of substantial weight gain in bipolar patients treated with olanzapine.,"To determine predictors of substantial weight gain (SWG) during treatment of bipolar disorder with olanzapine, data were pooled from 4 long-term randomized, multicenter studies in patients with bipolar mania or mixed mania (N = 948 at initiation of olanzapine). SWG was defined as gaining 5 kg or 7% of initial weight in 30 +/- 2 weeks. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios associated with early weight gain and baseline risk factors for predicting SWG. A classification system to identify patients at risk for SWG was constructed by recursive data partitioning. Baseline characteristics significantly associated with SWG included younger age, nonwhite ethnicity, lower body mass index (BMI), nonrapid cycling, and psychotic features. Weight gain of 2 or more kg in the first 3 weeks of therapy predicted SWG by 30 weeks (sensitivity = 57%; specificity = 71%).

SWG was defined as gaining 5 kg or 7% of initial weight in 30 +/- 2 weeks. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios associated with early weight gain and baseline risk factors for predicting SWG. A classification system to identify patients at risk for SWG was constructed by recursive data partitioning. Baseline characteristics significantly associated with SWG included younger age, nonwhite ethnicity, lower body mass index (BMI), nonrapid cycling, and psychotic features.

Other assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, and functional and quality-of-life measures. Safety was assessed via treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory tests, and movement disorder rating scales. Data were collected from December 2002 to September 2004. A total of 324 patients were randomized to 25 mg (N = 163) or 50 mg (N = 161) of long-acting risperidone. Time to relapse was comparable (p = .131) for both groups. Projected median time to relapse was 161.8 weeks (95% CI = 103.0 to 254.2) with 25 mg and 259.0 weeks (95% CI = 153.6 to 436.8) with 50 mg. One-year incidences of relapse were 21.6% (N = 35) and 14.9% (N = 24), respectively (p = .059). Psychiatric hospitalization was the reason for relapse for 16 (10%) in the 25-mg group and 10 (6%) in the 50-mg group. Patients experienced statistically significant but modest improvements at endpoint in most measures (i.e., psychotic symptoms, functioning, movement disorder severity) with both doses, with no significant between-group differences. In this 1-year study, long-acting risperidone was associated with low relapse and rehospitalization rates, indicating that doses of 25 to 50 mg are appropriate for long-term treatment in schizophrenia.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

17728418,Intensive psychosocial intervention enhances functioning in patients with bipolar depression: results from a 9-month randomized controlled trial.,"Psychosocial interventions are effective adjuncts to pharmacotherapy in delaying recurrences of bipolar disorder; however, to date their effects on life functioning have been given little attention. In a randomized trial, the authors examined the impact of intensive psychosocial treatment plus pharmacotherapy on the functional outcomes of patients with bipolar disorder over the 9 months following a depressive episode. Participants were 152 depressed outpatients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder in the multisite Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study. All patients received pharmacotherapy. Eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to intensive psychosocial intervention (30 sessions over 9 months of interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, cognitive behavior therapy [CBT], or family-focused therapy), and 68 patients were randomly assigned to collaborative care (a 3-session psychoeducational treatment). Independent evaluators rated the four subscales of the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation-Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT) (relationships, satisfaction with activities, work/role functioning, and recreational activities) through structured interviews given at baseline and every 3 months over a 9-month period. Patients in intensive psychotherapy had better total functioning, relationship functioning, and life satisfaction scores over 9 months than patients in collaborative care, even after pretreatment functioning and concurrent depression scores were covaried.

In a randomized trial, the authors examined the impact of intensive psychosocial treatment plus pharmacotherapy on the functional outcomes of patients with bipolar disorder over the 9 months following a depressive episode. Participants were 152 depressed outpatients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder in the multisite Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study. All patients received pharmacotherapy. Eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to intensive psychosocial intervention (30 sessions over 9 months of interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, cognitive behavior therapy [CBT], or family-focused therapy), and 68 patients were randomly assigned to collaborative care (a 3-session psychoeducational treatment). Independent evaluators rated the four subscales of the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation-Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT) (relationships, satisfaction with activities, work/role functioning, and recreational activities) through structured interviews given at baseline and every 3 months over a 9-month period. Patients in intensive psychotherapy had better total functioning, relationship functioning, and life satisfaction scores over 9 months than patients in collaborative care, even after pretreatment functioning and concurrent depression scores were covaried. No effects of psychosocial intervention were observed on work/role functioning or recreation scores during this 9-month period.

17728422,Nonresponse to treatment for depression following myocardial infarction: association with subsequent cardiac events.,"Depression following myocardial infarction is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, but attempts to alter cardiovascular prognosis by providing antidepressive treatment have not been successful. This may be because of the limited effects of antidepressive treatment on depression itself. The authors assessed whether nonresponse to treatment of post-myocardial infarction depression is associated with new cardiac events. The authors made a subgroup analysis of a multicenter randomized, clinical trial on the effects of antidepressant treatment for post-myocardial infarction depression. Patients were enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment with mirtazapine (30 mg/day) and, in the case of insufficient treatment response after 8 weeks, open treatment with citalopram. Patients were classified as responders to antidepressants (at least 50% reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating scale [HAM-D] score or HAM-D score <9 at 24 weeks) (N=43) or as nonresponders (N=27) and compared to untreated control subjects (N=98) on cardiac events (cardiac mortality or cardiac-related hospital admission) after 24 weeks post-random assignment and within 18 months after index infarction. The event rate was 25.6% among nonresponders, 11.2% among untreated control subjects, and 7.4% among responders. In relation to untreated comparison subjects, nonresponders had a hazard ratio of 2.66 for new cardiovascular events, which remained after the authors controlled for potential confounders (hazard ratio=2.92).

At Day 28 YMRS response rate was significantly greater with quetiapine than lithium (77.9% vs. 59.7%, p = 0.0132), and remission rates using the 3 criteria were significantly greater with quetiapine than lithium: YMRS total score < or = 12 (70.1% vs. 48.1%, p = 0.0071), YMRS < or = 12 + MADRS < or = 8 (70.1% vs. 48.1%; p = 0.0071), and YMRS < or = 8 (51.9% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.0147). Significant decreases were observed in PANSS, YMRS, and MADRS total scores for both groups. The most common AEs experienced by patients receiving quetiapine were constipation, dizziness, diarrhea, alanine aminotransferase increase, palpitations, aspartate aminotransferase increase, pharyngolaryngeal pain, upper respiratory tract infection and dry mouth. In patients receiving lithium, the most common AEs were nausea (16.9%), constipation (13.0%), vomiting (13.0%), nasopharyngitis (11.7%), dizziness (6.5%), diarrhea (6.5%), and upper respiratory tract infection (6.5%).

The proportion of simulations when clozapine was more cost-effective than other SGAs reached 50% if decision-makers are prepared to pay 30,000 pound to 35,000 pound per QALY. This is at the top of the range of acceptable willingness-to-pay values per QALY implied by decisions taken by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). This study adds to a limited body of evidence comparing clozapine to other SGAs and is the first economic and clinical RCT to compare clozapine to the class of other SGAs using the lower cost of generic clozapine and a pragmatic trial design. Policy decisions by the NICE suggest that additional reasons would be needed to accept clozapine as effective and efficient if it had a high probability of having ICERs more than 35,000 pound per QALY.

This is at the top of the range of acceptable willingness-to-pay values per QALY implied by decisions taken by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). This study adds to a limited body of evidence comparing clozapine to other SGAs and is the first economic and clinical RCT to compare clozapine to the class of other SGAs using the lower cost of generic clozapine and a pragmatic trial design. Policy decisions by the NICE suggest that additional reasons would be needed to accept clozapine as effective and efficient if it had a high probability of having ICERs more than 35,000 pound per QALY. The results and limitations of the analysis suggest that there is still a need for further economic evaluation of clozapine.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

Cognitive remediation interventions have thus far demonstrated minimal effects on attention, as have medications. There is thus a gap between the existence of effective psychosocial treatments and patients' ability to effectively engage in and benefit from them. We report on the results of a multisite study of attention shaping (AS), a behavioral intervention for improving attentiveness and learning of social skills among highly distractible schizophrenia patients. Patients with chronic schizophrenia who were refractory to skills training were assigned to receive either the UCLA Basic Conversation Skills Module (BCSM) augmented with AS (n = 47) or in the standard format (n = 35). AS, a reward-based learning procedure, was employed to facilitate patients' meeting clearly defined and individualized attentiveness and participation goals during each session of a social skills training group. Primary outcome measures were observational ratings of attentiveness in each session and pre- and post-BCSM ratings of social skill and symptoms. Patients receiving social skills training augmented with AS demonstrated significantly more attentiveness in group sessions and higher levels of skill acquisition; moreover, significant relationships were found between changes in attentiveness and amount of skills acquired. Changes in attentiveness were unrelated to level or change in antipsychotic medication dose.

This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of iloperidone in patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. This randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study comprised a 1-week titration period and a 3-week double-blind maintenance period. Eligible patients (n = 593) were randomized to iloperidone 24 mg/d, ziprasidone 160 mg/d as an active control, or placebo. Primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Total (PANSS-T) score, using a mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis. Iloperidone demonstrated significant reduction versus placebo on the PANSS-T score (P< 0.01). Significant improvement versus placebo was also demonstrated with ziprasidone (P < 0.05). Compared with ziprasidone, iloperidone was associated with lower rates of many adverse events (AEs) that are particularly troublesome with antipsychotics, including sedation, somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, agitation, and restlessness; iloperidone was associated with higher rates of weight gain, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and nasal congestion as reported as an AE. Most AEs were mild to moderate. A similar amount of QT prolongation was observed with both active treatments, although no patient had a treatment-emergent postbaseline corrected QT interval of 500 msec or greater. The incidence of clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters was comparable between iloperidone and ziprasidone. Iloperidone was associated with a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms.

18408525,Venlafaxine extended release versus citalopram in patients with depression unresponsive to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.,"Findings from the National Institute of Mental Health's Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial indicate that approximately 50% of patients with major depressive disorder do not experience a treatment response after adequate first-line treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that, after treatment failure with an SSRI, switching to venlafaxine extended release (ER) would offer advantages over switching to another SSRI, citalopram. The objectives of this trial were to compare the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine ER and citalopram in the treatment of moderate-to-severe depression in patients who did not experience a treatment response to an SSRI other than citalopram and to investigate the effects of severity of depression by categorizing treatment groups according to baseline severity. This was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Participants were adult outpatients who, following 8 weeks of monotherapy with an adequate dosing regimen of an SSRI other than citalopram and had not responded, met the diagnostic criteria for depression as described in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, and had a score > or =20 on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21). After a 7-day screening period, patients were randomly assigned to receive venlafaxine ER 75 mg/day or citalopram 20 mg/day for the first 2 weeks. Doses could be increased every 2 weeks through week 6. Treatment lasted 12 weeks and was followed by a 1-week tapering period. Maximum dosages were venlafaxine ER 300 mg/day or citalopram 60 mg/day. The primary end point was the final on-therapy total HAM-D21 score. To investigate the treatment effects of the severity of depression on efficacy, a subgroup analysis was performed for baseline HAM-D21 total score < or =31 and >31. The analyses for HAM-D21, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impressions - Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scores were based on intent-to-treat (ITT) population, for both the primary analysis and subgroup analysis according to baseline HAM-D21 total scores < or =31 or >31. Safety assessments included the recording of adverse events (AEs). A total of 406 patients (200 venlafaxine ER, 206 citalopram) were randomly assigned and 396 patients were included in the ITT population (194 venlafaxine ER, 202 citalopram). Treatment groups were similar in terms of demographics and baseline psychiatric assessments.

18418363,Estimates of serotonin and norepinephrine transporter inhibition in depressed patients treated with paroxetine or venlafaxine.,"Paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent serotonin transporter (SERT) antagonists and weaker norepinephrine transporter (NET) antagonists. However, the relative magnitude of effect at each of these sites during treatment is unknown. Using a novel blood assay that estimates CNS transporter occupancy we estimated the relative SERT and NET occupancy of paroxetine and venlafaxine in human subjects to assess the relative magnitude of SERT and NET inhibition. Outpatient subjects (N=86) meeting criteria for major depression were enrolled in a multicenter, 8 week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, antidepressant treatment study. Subjects were treated by forced-titration of paroxetine CR (12.5-75 mg/day) or venlafaxine XR (75-375 mg/day) over 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected weekly to estimate transporter inhibition. Both medications produced dose-dependent inhibition of the SERT and NET. Maximal SERT inhibition at week 8 for paroxetine and venlafaxine was 90% (SD 7) and 85% (SD 10), respectively. Maximal NET inhibition for paroxetine and venlafaxine at week 8 was 36% (SD 19) and 60% (SD 13), respectively.

A pooled analysis of 3 similarly designed 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled studies in 1326 patients with acute schizophrenia (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] total score of 70-120) was performed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 mg daily of paliperidone ER or placebo. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed. The primary endpoint was change in PANSS total score from baseline to endpoint. PANSS total, PANSS subscale factor, and Personal and Social Performance scale scores significantly improved at endpoint for all doses of paliperidone ER relative to placebo (p <or= .001). A significantly greater proportion of paliperidone ER-treated patients at all doses achieved a clinical response compared with placebo (p <or= .001). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 66% to 77% of patients in the paliperidone ER groups and 66% of patients in the placebo group; serious TEAEs occurred in 6% of patients who received placebo and 5% to 6% of paliperidone ER-treated patients.

18505948,Escitalopram and problem-solving therapy for prevention of poststroke depression: a randomized controlled trial.,"Depression occurs in more than half of patients who have experienced a stroke. Poststroke depression has been shown in numerous studies to be associated with both impaired recovery in activities of daily living and increased mortality. Prevention of depression thus represents a potentially important goal. To determine whether treatment with escitalopram or problem-solving therapy over the first year following acute stroke will decrease the number of depression cases that develop compared with placebo medication. A multisite randomized controlled trial for prevention of depression among 176 nondepressed patients was conducted within 3 months following acute stroke from July 9, 2003, to October 1, 2007. The 12-month trial included 3 groups: a double-blind placebo-controlled comparison of escitalopram (n = 59) with placebo (n = 58), and a nonblinded problem-solving therapy group (n = 59). The main outcome measure was the development of major or minor poststroke depression based on symptoms elicited by the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) and the diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV for depression due to stroke with major depressive-like episode or minor depression (ie, research criteria). Patients who received placebo were significantly more likely to develop depression than individuals who received escitalopram (11 major and 2 minor cases of depression [22.4%] vs 3 major and 2 minor cases of depression [8.5%], adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-8.2; P < .001) and also more likely than individuals who received problem-solving therapy (5 major and 2 minor cases of depression [11.9%], adjusted HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < .001). These results were adjusted for history of mood disorders and remained significant after considering possible confounders such as age, sex, treatment site, and severity of impairment in the model. Using an intention-to-treat conservative method of analyzing the data, which assumed that all 27 patients who did not start randomized treatment would have developed depression, and controlling for prior history of mood disorders, escitalopram was superior to placebo (23.1% vs 34.5%; adjusted HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9; P = .007), while problem-solving therapy was not significantly better than placebo (30.5% vs 34.5%; adjusted HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.5; P = .51). Adverse events, including all-cause hospitalizations, nausea, and adverse effects associated with escitalopram were not significantly different between the 3 groups.

1864255,[Treatment of resistant depression with the citalopram-lithium combination. Methodology of a double-blind multicenter study and preliminary results].,"Citalopram, a new bicyclic antidepressant, is the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In a number of double-blind controlled studies, citalopram was compared to placebo and to known tricyclic antidepressants. These studies have shown their efficacy and good safety. The inefficacy of a psychotropic treatment in at least 20% of depressives has led a number of authors to propose original drug combinations and associations, like antidepressant/lithium (Li), antidepressant/sleep deprivation (agrypnia), antidepressant/ECT, or antidepressant/LT3. The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a combined citalopram/lithium treatment in therapy-resistant patients, taking account of serotonergic functions, as tested by the fenfluramine/prolactin test, and of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of metabolism. A washout period of 3 days before initiating the treatment is included. After an open treatment phase of 28 days (D) with citalopram (20 mg D1-D3; 40 mg D4-D14; 40 or 60 mg D15-D28; concomitant medication allowed: chloral, chlorazepate), the nonresponding patients [less than 50% improvement in the total score on the 21 item-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)] are selected and treated with or without Li (randomized in double-blind conditions: citalopram/Li or citalopram/placebo) during the treatment (D29-D35). Thereafter, all patients included in the double-blind phase subsequently receive an open treatment with citalopram/Li for 7 days (D36-D42). The hypothesis of a relationship between serotoninergic functions in patients using the fenfluramine/prolactin test (D1) and the clinical response to citalopram (and Li) is assessed. Moreover, it is evaluated whether the pharmacogenetic status of the patients, as determined by the mephenytoin/dextromethorphan test (D0-D28), is related to the metabolism of fenfluramine and citalopram, and also to the clinical response. Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorders according to DSM III are submitted to a clinical assessment of D1, D7, D14, D28, D35, D42: HDRS, CGI (clinical global impression), VAS (visual analog scales for self-rating of depression), HDRS (Hamilton depression rating scale, 21 items), UKU (side effects scale), and to clinical laboratory examens, as well as ECG, control of weight, pulse, blood pressure at D1, D28, D35. Fenfluramine/prolactin test: A butterfly needle is inserted in a forearm vein at 7 h 45 and is kept patent with liquemine.

Methodology of a double-blind multicenter study and preliminary results].,"Citalopram, a new bicyclic antidepressant, is the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In a number of double-blind controlled studies, citalopram was compared to placebo and to known tricyclic antidepressants. These studies have shown their efficacy and good safety. The inefficacy of a psychotropic treatment in at least 20% of depressives has led a number of authors to propose original drug combinations and associations, like antidepressant/lithium (Li), antidepressant/sleep deprivation (agrypnia), antidepressant/ECT, or antidepressant/LT3. The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a combined citalopram/lithium treatment in therapy-resistant patients, taking account of serotonergic functions, as tested by the fenfluramine/prolactin test, and of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of metabolism. A washout period of 3 days before initiating the treatment is included. After an open treatment phase of 28 days (D) with citalopram (20 mg D1-D3; 40 mg D4-D14; 40 or 60 mg D15-D28; concomitant medication allowed: chloral, chlorazepate), the nonresponding patients [less than 50% improvement in the total score on the 21 item-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)] are selected and treated with or without Li (randomized in double-blind conditions: citalopram/Li or citalopram/placebo) during the treatment (D29-D35). Thereafter, all patients included in the double-blind phase subsequently receive an open treatment with citalopram/Li for 7 days (D36-D42). The hypothesis of a relationship between serotoninergic functions in patients using the fenfluramine/prolactin test (D1) and the clinical response to citalopram (and Li) is assessed. Moreover, it is evaluated whether the pharmacogenetic status of the patients, as determined by the mephenytoin/dextromethorphan test (D0-D28), is related to the metabolism of fenfluramine and citalopram, and also to the clinical response. Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorders according to DSM III are submitted to a clinical assessment of D1, D7, D14, D28, D35, D42: HDRS, CGI (clinical global impression), VAS (visual analog scales for self-rating of depression), HDRS (Hamilton depression rating scale, 21 items), UKU (side effects scale), and to clinical laboratory examens, as well as ECG, control of weight, pulse, blood pressure at D1, D28, D35.

Increases in AUC 0- to 2-hour glucose values were statistically significant with olanzapine (+21.9 mg/dL x h, 95% CI = 11.5 to 32.4 mg/dL x h) and risperidone (+18.8 mg/dL x h, 95% CI = 8.1 to 29.4 mg/dL x h), but not quetiapine (+9.1 mg/dL x h, 95% CI = -2.3 to 20.5 mg/dL x h). AUC 0- to 2-hour insulin values increased statistically significantly with olanzapine (+24.5%, 95% CI = 11.5% to 39.0%), but not with quetiapine or risperidone. Reductions in insulin sensitivity index were statistically significant with olanzapine (-19.1%, 95% CI = -27.9% to -9.3%) and risperidone (-15.8%, 95% CI = -25.1% to -5.4%), but not quetiapine. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels increased statistically significantly with olanzapine (+21.1 mg/dL, 95% CI = 13.0 to 29.2 mg/dL, and +20.5 mg/dL, 95% CI = 13.8 to 27.1 mg/dL, respectively) and quetiapine (+13.1 mg/dL, 95% CI = 4.3 to 21.9 mg/dL, and +13.3 mg/dL, 95% CI = 6.1 to 20.5 mg/dL, respectively), but not risperidone.

This 8-week (6-week active-treatment, randomized phase; 2-week posttreatment drug-discontinuation/tapering phase), multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted between April 2006 and May 2007. In total, 612 patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)-defined MDD were randomly assigned to quetiapine XR 150 mg/day or 300 mg/day, duloxetine 60 mg/day (active control), or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. At week 6, both doses of quetiapine XR (p < .001) and duloxetine (p < .01) significantly reduced mean MADRS total score versus placebo.

20547037,Effect of aripiprazole versus haloperidol on PANSS Prosocial items in early-episode patients with schizophrenia.,"Improving social functioning is critically important in early-episode schizophrenia, if patients are to achieve functional recovery. This post-hoc, pooled analysis of two studies compared the effect of aripiprazole versus haloperidol on social functioning in early-episode schizophrenia. Data were pooled from two 52 week, randomized (2:1), double-blind, multicenter studies involving 1294 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were in an acute psychotic episode and had a history of positive antipsychotic response during previous episodes. The early-episode group was defined as patients who are <or=40 years of age with <or=5 years' duration of illness. Social functioning was assessed by mean change from baseline on the PANSS Prosocial subscale (ANCOVA and LOCF), comprising six PANSS items, and the Modified Prosocial subscale, comprising four PANSS items. Measurements were taken at approximately monthly intervals for up to 1 year. Aripiprazole (n=237) demonstrated significant improvement versus haloperidol (n=123) as early as Week 18 on both the Prosocial subscale (-4.75 versus -3.78, p<0.05) and on the Modified Prosocial subscale (-3.16 versus -2.28, p<0.05). Patients receiving aripiprazole continued to show similar significant improvement versus haloperidol at all remaining timepoints through Week 52 using the Modified Prosocial subscale, but less consistent improvement with the Prosocial subscale.

This post-hoc, pooled analysis of two studies compared the effect of aripiprazole versus haloperidol on social functioning in early-episode schizophrenia. Data were pooled from two 52 week, randomized (2:1), double-blind, multicenter studies involving 1294 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were in an acute psychotic episode and had a history of positive antipsychotic response during previous episodes. The early-episode group was defined as patients who are <or=40 years of age with <or=5 years' duration of illness. Social functioning was assessed by mean change from baseline on the PANSS Prosocial subscale (ANCOVA and LOCF), comprising six PANSS items, and the Modified Prosocial subscale, comprising four PANSS items. Measurements were taken at approximately monthly intervals for up to 1 year. Aripiprazole (n=237) demonstrated significant improvement versus haloperidol (n=123) as early as Week 18 on both the Prosocial subscale (-4.75 versus -3.78, p<0.05) and on the Modified Prosocial subscale (-3.16 versus -2.28, p<0.05). Patients receiving aripiprazole continued to show similar significant improvement versus haloperidol at all remaining timepoints through Week 52 using the Modified Prosocial subscale, but less consistent improvement with the Prosocial subscale. Significant advantage for the aripiprazole-treated patients was observed at Weeks 46 and 52 (endpoint) with both subscales.

The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the main secondary outcome measures were the HDRS-17 and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings. Data were collected from 2003 to 2006. Results of the primary efficacy analysis of the randomized patients using the MADRS, HDRS-17, CGI-S, and CGI-I did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo groups, although some secondary analyses were suggestive of efficacy, particularly in those patients who completed the study (completer analysis) and in more severely ill patients (HDRS-17 ≥ 25). This add-on study of patients with treatment-resistant depression failed to detect a statistically significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo given for 10 weeks.

In this multicenter trial, conducted at 19 sites, patients aged 18-65 years with a DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnosis of unipolar, nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) who had failed at least 1 adequate trial of an antidepressant (N = 183) were first treated for 8 weeks with open-label paroxetine or paroxetine controlled-release in dosages up to 50 mg/d or 62.5 mg/d, respectively. Individuals with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score ≥ 15 (n = 96) were then randomized on a double-blind basis to receive either placebo or lamotrigine in dosages titrated upward to a maximum of 400 mg/d for 10 weeks. Sixty-five patients completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the main secondary outcome measures were the HDRS-17 and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings. Data were collected from 2003 to 2006. Results of the primary efficacy analysis of the randomized patients using the MADRS, HDRS-17, CGI-S, and CGI-I did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo groups, although some secondary analyses were suggestive of efficacy, particularly in those patients who completed the study (completer analysis) and in more severely ill patients (HDRS-17 ≥ 25). This add-on study of patients with treatment-resistant depression failed to detect a statistically significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo given for 10 weeks. However, post hoc analyses suggest that future studies of lamotrigine's efficacy might focus on specific subgroups with depression. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00901407.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

21534651,Psychological treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia: a randomized controlled trial to examine the role of therapist-guided exposure in situ in CBT.,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Nevertheless, an understanding of its mechanisms and particularly the role of therapist-guided exposure is lacking. This study was aimed to evaluate whether therapist-guided exposure in situ is associated with more pervasive and long-lasting effects than therapist-prescribed exposure in situ. A multicenter randomized controlled trial, in which 369 PD/AG patients were treated and followed up for 6 months. Patients were randomized to 2 manual-based variants of CBT (T+/T-) or a wait-list control group (WL; n = 68) and were treated twice weekly for 12 sessions. CBT variants were identical in content, structure, and length, except for implementation of exposure in situ: In the T+ variant (n = 163), therapists planned and supervised exposure in situ exercises outside the therapy room; in the T- group (n = 138), therapists planned and discussed patients' in situ exposure exercises but did not accompany them. Primary outcome measures were (a) Hamilton Anxiety Scale, (b) Clinical Global Impression, (c) number of panic attacks, and (d) agoraphobic avoidance (Mobility Inventory). For T+ and T- compared with WL, all outcome measures improved significantly with large effect sizes from baseline to post (range = -0.5 to -2.5) and from post to follow-up (range = -0.02 to -1.0). T+ improved more than T- on the Clinical Global Impression and Mobility Inventory at post and follow-up and had greater reduction in panic attacks during the follow-up period. Reduction in agoraphobic avoidance accelerated after exposure was introduced. A dose-response relation was found for Time × Frequency of Exposure and reduction in agoraphobic avoidance. Therapist-guided exposure is more effective for agoraphobic avoidance, overall functioning, and panic attacks in the follow-up period than is CBT without therapist-guided exposure.

This study was aimed to evaluate whether therapist-guided exposure in situ is associated with more pervasive and long-lasting effects than therapist-prescribed exposure in situ. A multicenter randomized controlled trial, in which 369 PD/AG patients were treated and followed up for 6 months. Patients were randomized to 2 manual-based variants of CBT (T+/T-) or a wait-list control group (WL; n = 68) and were treated twice weekly for 12 sessions. CBT variants were identical in content, structure, and length, except for implementation of exposure in situ: In the T+ variant (n = 163), therapists planned and supervised exposure in situ exercises outside the therapy room; in the T- group (n = 138), therapists planned and discussed patients' in situ exposure exercises but did not accompany them. Primary outcome measures were (a) Hamilton Anxiety Scale, (b) Clinical Global Impression, (c) number of panic attacks, and (d) agoraphobic avoidance (Mobility Inventory). For T+ and T- compared with WL, all outcome measures improved significantly with large effect sizes from baseline to post (range = -0.5 to -2.5) and from post to follow-up (range = -0.02 to -1.0). T+ improved more than T- on the Clinical Global Impression and Mobility Inventory at post and follow-up and had greater reduction in panic attacks during the follow-up period. Reduction in agoraphobic avoidance accelerated after exposure was introduced. A dose-response relation was found for Time × Frequency of Exposure and reduction in agoraphobic avoidance. Therapist-guided exposure is more effective for agoraphobic avoidance, overall functioning, and panic attacks in the follow-up period than is CBT without therapist-guided exposure. Therapist-guided exposure promotes additional therapeutic improvement--possibly mediated by increased physical engagement in feared situations--beyond the effects of a CBT treatment in which exposure is simply instructed.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

Furthermore, the article describes a clinical study (the TONES-Study, ISRCTN 25455020), which aims to investigate whether CBT is specifically efficacious for the reduction of negative symptoms. This multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing CBT with cognitive remediation (CR) for control of nonspecific effects is depicted in detail. In our trial, schizophrenia patients (n = 198) participated in manualized individual outpatient treatments. Primary outcome is the negative syndrome assessed with the positive and negative syndrome scale, analyzed with multilevel linear mixed models. Patients in both groups moderately improved regarding the primary endpoint. However, against expectation, there was no difference between the groups after treatment in the intention to treat as well as in the per-protocol analysis. In conclusion, psychotherapeutic intervention may be useful for the reduction of negative symptoms. However, there is no indication for specific effects of CBT compared with CR.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

Our aim in this study was to assess the effectiveness of cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and the recommended pharmacological treatment (RPT) compared with treatment as usual (TAU) at the primary care level for the treatment of PC in fibromyalgia patients. We conducted a six-month, multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel group, controlled trial in which patients were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: CBT (n = 57), RPT (n = 56) and TAU at the primary care level (n = 56). The major outcome of this study was PC in patients with fibromyalgia. The secondary variables were pain acceptance, depression, anxiety, pain, global function and quality of life. CBT significantly decreased global PC at the six-month follow-up examination with effect sizes of Cohen's d = 0.73 and 1.01 compared with RPT and TAU, respectively. CBT was also more effective than RPT and TAU at increasing pain acceptance at the six-month follow-up examination (effect sizes of Cohen's d = 0.77 and 0.80, respectively). Compared with RPT and TAU, CBT was more effective at improving global function based on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (six-month effect sizes Cohen's d = 0.44 and 0.53, respectively) and quality of life based on the European Quality of Life Scale (six-month effect sizes Cohen's d = 0.11 and 0.40, respectively).

We thus conducted an analysis that assessed key efficacy and tolerability outcomes post hoc from four pooled short-term (4-6 weeks) phase III studies that evaluated iloperidone versus placebo in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patient-level data were pooled from four prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, multicenter trials of iloperidone in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder aged 18-65 years. Iloperidone 4-8, 10-16, and 20-24 mg/day (all dosed twice daily) were compared with placebo. Active controls used for assay sensitivity included risperidone 4-8 mg/day, haloperidol 15 mg/day, and ziprasidone 160 mg/day. Outcomes of interest were change from baseline to endpoint in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (derived) (BPRSd), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-total (PANSS-T) score, and PANSS-positive (PANSS-P) and PANSS-negative (PANSS-N) subscale scores. An analysis of covariance (with treatment and study as factors, baseline as a covariate) was performed to compare changes between the iloperidone treatment groups versus placebo, on the basis of a last-observation-carried-forward approach for the intent-to-treat (ITT) populations. Tolerability outcomes were obtained from spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), and number needed to harm was calculated for each antipsychotic versus placebo for the total population. The ITT population included both schizoaffective and schizophrenia patients (N = 2401): n = 370, n = 494, and n = 424 for iloperidone 4-8, 10-16, and 20-24 mg/day, respectively; n = 294 for risperidone; n = 114 for haloperidol; n = 144 for ziprasidone; and n = 561 for placebo. Treatment with iloperidone 10-16 mg/day or 20-24 mg/day was associated with significantly improved BPRSd, PANSS-T, PANSS-P, and PANSS-N scores versus treatment with placebo. When only patients with schizophrenia were included (n = 1941), the pattern of results was essentially unchanged. The active controls confirmed assay sensitivity.

We thus conducted an analysis that assessed key efficacy and tolerability outcomes post hoc from four pooled short-term (4-6 weeks) phase III studies that evaluated iloperidone versus placebo in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patient-level data were pooled from four prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, multicenter trials of iloperidone in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder aged 18-65 years. Iloperidone 4-8, 10-16, and 20-24 mg/day (all dosed twice daily) were compared with placebo. Active controls used for assay sensitivity included risperidone 4-8 mg/day, haloperidol 15 mg/day, and ziprasidone 160 mg/day. Outcomes of interest were change from baseline to endpoint in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (derived) (BPRSd), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-total (PANSS-T) score, and PANSS-positive (PANSS-P) and PANSS-negative (PANSS-N) subscale scores. An analysis of covariance (with treatment and study as factors, baseline as a covariate) was performed to compare changes between the iloperidone treatment groups versus placebo, on the basis of a last-observation-carried-forward approach for the intent-to-treat (ITT) populations. Tolerability outcomes were obtained from spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), and number needed to harm was calculated for each antipsychotic versus placebo for the total population. The ITT population included both schizoaffective and schizophrenia patients (N = 2401): n = 370, n = 494, and n = 424 for iloperidone 4-8, 10-16, and 20-24 mg/day, respectively; n = 294 for risperidone; n = 114 for haloperidol; n = 144 for ziprasidone; and n = 561 for placebo. Treatment with iloperidone 10-16 mg/day or 20-24 mg/day was associated with significantly improved BPRSd, PANSS-T, PANSS-P, and PANSS-N scores versus treatment with placebo. When only patients with schizophrenia were included (n = 1941), the pattern of results was essentially unchanged. The active controls confirmed assay sensitivity.

We used baseline data from a randomized, multicenter study of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder who were experiencing an acute symptom exacerbation (n = 628) to examine the relationship among several outcome measures.

Three analytic approaches were used: 1) path analysis; 2) factor analysis; and 3) categorical latent variable analysis. In the optimal path model, the SWN-K was selected as the final outcome, while the SOFI mediated the effect of the exogenous variables (PANSS, MADRS) on the QLS. The overall model explained 47% of variance in QLS and 17% of the variance in SOFI, but only 15% in SWN-K. Factor analysis suggested four factors: ""Functioning,"" ""Daily Living,"" ""Depression,"" and ""Psychopathology."" A strong positive correlation was observed between the SOFI and QLS (r = 0.669), and both the QLS and SOFI loaded on the ""Functioning"" factor, suggesting redundancy between these scales. The measurement profiles from the categorical latent variable analysis showed significant variation in functioning and quality of life despite similar levels of psychopathology.

Neuropsychiatric problems, such as PSDA, have a negative impact on social reintegration and quality of life. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment available for reducing PSDA symptoms. In the recent literature on depression in the general population it has been shown that depression complaints can diminish by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In the current study, the effectiveness of augmented, activation-based and individually tailored CBT on the reduction of depression and anxiety will be investigated in patients with PSDA. Additionally, the effects on various secondary outcome measures, such as quality of life, goal attainment and societal participation will be evaluated. This study is embedded in a consortium of 4 interrelated studies on quality of life after stroke (Restore4Stroke). A multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial is conducted. A sample of 106 PSDA patients, as assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS depression subscale >7), will be recruited and randomly allocated to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental intervention consists of an augmented CBT intervention. The intervention is based on CBT principles of recognizing, registering, and altering negative thoughts and cognitions so that mood, and emotional symptoms are improved.

Adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and normal electrocardiograms at baseline (N = 188) were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to iloperidone, 8 mg twice daily (BID), 12 mg BID, 24 mg once daily (QD); quetiapine, 375 mg BID; or ziprasidone, 80 mg BID during period 1 (no metabolic inhibitors present). Iloperidone BID produced mean changes in QTc Fridericia correction (QTcF) interval (8.5-9.0 milliseconds [ms]) similar to those produced by ziprasidone (9.6 ms) and higher than those produced by quetiapine (1.3 ms). Iloperidone, 24 mg QD, produced a mean QTcF change of 15.4 ms. Coadministration of metabolic inhibitors with iloperidone during periods 2 (paroxetine) and 3 (paroxetine and ketoconazole) resulted in greater increases in the QTc interval. Increased QTc was observed in individuals with specific cytochrome P450 2D6 polymorphisms. Up to 10% of patients on iloperidone experienced QTc intervals of 60 ms or longer in the presence of metabolic inhibition and QD dosing. However, no patients experienced QTc changes of clinical concern (QTc ≥ 500 ms). The most common adverse events with iloperidone were headache, anxiety, and dyspepsia.

23319006,MAOA and mechanisms of panic disorder revisited: from bench to molecular psychotherapy.,"Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG) is a prevalent mental disorder featuring a substantial complex genetic component. At present, only a few established risk genes exist. Among these, the gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is noteworthy given that genetic variation has been demonstrated to influence gene expression and monoamine levels. Long alleles of the MAOA-uVNTR promoter polymorphism are associated with PD/AG and correspond with increased enzyme activity. Here, we have thus investigated the impact of MAOA-uVNTR on therapy response, behavioral avoidance and brain activity in fear conditioning in a large controlled and randomized multicenter study on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG. The study consisted of 369 PD/AG patients, and genetic information was available for 283 patients. Carriers of the risk allele had significantly worse outcome as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety scale (46% responders vs 67%, P=0.017). This was accompanied by elevated heart rate and increased fear during an anxiety-provoking situation, that is, the behavioral avoidance task. All but one panic attack that happened during this task occurred in risk allele carriers and, furthermore, risk allele carriers did not habituate to the situation during repetitive exposure. Finally, functional neuroimaging during a classical fear conditioning paradigm evidenced that the protective allele is associated with increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex upon presentation of the CS+ during acquisition of fear. Further differentiation between high- and low-risk subjects after treatment was observed in the inferior parietal lobes, suggesting differential brain activation patterns upon CBT. Taken together, we established that a genetic risk factor for PD/AG is associated with worse response to CBT and identify potential underlying neural mechanisms.

This analysis aimed to compare different definitions of response in a large sample of children and adolescents. Anexploratory analysis of a 4-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study assessed patients (n=296; ages, 10-17 years) with an acute manic/mixed episode associated with BIPOLAR I disorder who were randomized to aripiprazole (10 or 30 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 4 in young mania rating scale (YMRS) total score. Additional assessments included: clinical global impressions-bipolar disorder (CGI-BP) Overall and mania scales, child global assessment scale (CGAS), and parent and subject general behavior inventory. Response was compared across seven operational definitions. Cohen's κ and Spearman's correlation tested relationships between various response definitions or changes in outcome measures and clinically meaningful improvement (defined as a CGI-BP overall improvement score of 1 or 2). Response rates varied depending upon the operational definition, but were highest for 95% reliable change (statistical method used to determine individual change from previous assessment) and ≥33% reduction in YMRS total score. Response rate definitions with the highest validity in terms of predicting clinically meaningful improvement were: ≥50% reduction on YMRS (κ=0.64), a composite definition of response (YMRS <12.5, children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) ≤40, and CGAS ≥51; κ=0.59), and 95% reliable change on the CGAS or 33% reduction on YMRS (κ=0.56). Parent ratings of symptoms were generally better at detecting symptom improvement than were subject ratings (κ=∼0.4-0.5 vs. ∼0.2 when compared with CGI-BP overall improvement score).

Anexploratory analysis of a 4-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled study assessed patients (n=296; ages, 10-17 years) with an acute manic/mixed episode associated with BIPOLAR I disorder who were randomized to aripiprazole (10 or 30 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 4 in young mania rating scale (YMRS) total score. Additional assessments included: clinical global impressions-bipolar disorder (CGI-BP) Overall and mania scales, child global assessment scale (CGAS), and parent and subject general behavior inventory. Response was compared across seven operational definitions. Cohen's κ and Spearman's correlation tested relationships between various response definitions or changes in outcome measures and clinically meaningful improvement (defined as a CGI-BP overall improvement score of 1 or 2). Response rates varied depending upon the operational definition, but were highest for 95% reliable change (statistical method used to determine individual change from previous assessment) and ≥33% reduction in YMRS total score. Response rate definitions with the highest validity in terms of predicting clinically meaningful improvement were: ≥50% reduction on YMRS (κ=0.64), a composite definition of response (YMRS <12.5, children's depression rating scale-revised (CDRS-R) ≤40, and CGAS ≥51; κ=0.59), and 95% reliable change on the CGAS or 33% reduction on YMRS (κ=0.56). Parent ratings of symptoms were generally better at detecting symptom improvement than were subject ratings (κ=∼0.4-0.5 vs. ∼0.2 when compared with CGI-BP overall improvement score). Clinically meaningful definitions of response in acute treatment of a manic/mixed episode in pediatric subjects include a 50% change in YMRS and a composite measure of response.

The authors tested the efficacy of psychodynamic therapy and CBT in social anxiety disorder in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHOD In an outpatient setting, 495 patients with social anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to manual-guided CBT (N=209), manual-guided psychodynamic therapy (N=207), or a waiting list condition (N=79). Assessments were made at baseline and at end of treatment. Primary outcome measures were rates of remission and response, based on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale applied by raters blind to group assignment. Several secondary measures were assessed as well. RESULTS Remission rates in the CBT, psychodynamic therapy, and waiting list groups were 36%, 26%, and 9%, respectively. Response rates were 60%, 52%, and 15%, respectively. CBT and psychodynamic therapy were significantly superior to waiting list for both remission and response. CBT was significantly superior to psychodynamic therapy for remission but not for response. Between-group effect sizes for remission and response were small.

23683841,Efficacy of a dilemma-focused intervention for unipolar depression: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Depression is one of the more severe and serious health problems because of its morbidity, disabling effects and for its societal and economic burden. Despite the variety of existing pharmacological and psychological treatments, most of the cases evolve with only partial remission, relapse and recurrence.Cognitive models have contributed significantly to the understanding of unipolar depression and its psychological treatment. However, success is only partial and many authors affirm the need to improve those models and also the treatment programs derived from them. One of the issues that requires further elaboration is the difficulty these patients experience in responding to treatment and in maintaining therapeutic gains across time without relapse or recurrence. Our research group has been working on the notion of cognitive conflict viewed as personal dilemmas according to personal construct theory. We use a novel method for identifying those conflicts using the repertory grid technique (RGT). Preliminary results with depressive patients show that about 90% of them have one or more of those conflicts. This fact might explain the blockage and the difficult progress of these patients, especially the more severe and/or chronic. These results justify the need for specific interventions focused on the resolution of these internal conflicts. This study aims to empirically test the hypothesis that an intervention focused on the dilemma(s) specifically detected for each patient will enhance the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. A therapy manual for a dilemma-focused intervention will be tested using a randomized clinical trial by comparing the outcome of two treatment conditions: combined group CBT (eight, 2-hour weekly sessions) plus individual dilemma-focused therapy (eight, 1-hour weekly sessions) and CBT alone (eight, 2-hour group weekly sessions plus eight, 1-hour individual weekly sessions). Participants are patients aged over 18 years meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder, with a score of 19 or above on the Beck depression inventory, second edition (BDI-II) and presenting at least one cognitive conflict (implicative dilemma or dilemmatic construct) as assessed using the RGT. The BDI-II is the primary outcome measure, collected at baseline, at the end of therapy, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up; other secondary measures are also used.

This was a multicenter prospective randomized observer-blinded study with two parallel groups. The authors assessed 180 patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes who met remission criteria over a 2-month baseline period and who were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of either maintenance CBT or manualized psychoeducation over 8 months and then followed up for 12 months. The main outcome measure was time to first relapse or recurrence of a major depression, based on DSM-IV criteria, as assessed by blinded observers with the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. Cox regression analysis showed that time to relapse or recurrence of major depression did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, but a significant interaction was observed between treatment condition and number of previous episodes (<5 or ≥5). Within the subsample of patients with five or more previous episodes, maintenance CBT was significantly superior to manualized psychoeducation, whereas for patients with fewer than five previous episodes, no significant treatment differences were observed in time to relapse or recurrence.

Use of dopamine-enhancing drugs (eg, psychostimulants) has been limited by potential adverse effects. This multicenter study examined lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), a d-amphetamine prodrug, as adjunctive therapy to antipsychotics in adults with clinically stable schizophrenia and predominant NSS. Outpatients with stable schizophrenia, predominant NSS, limited positive symptoms, and maintained on stable atypical antipsychotic therapy underwent a 3-week screening, 10-week open-label adjunctive LDX (20-70 mg/day), and 4-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal. Efficacy measures included a modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS-18) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and subscale scores.

No subjects had Fridericia's corrected QT (QTcF) ≥ 500 ms in the RCT or OLE phases. One completed suicide occurred during the OLE phase. For RCT and OLE, no clinically significant changes were reported in metabolic indices and laboratory measures. Ziprasidone failed to separate from placebo in treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated with an overall neutral weight and metabolic profile.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique with few side effects that has been reported to be useful in the treatment of depression. However, no studies to date have evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the efficacy of rTMS for maintenance treatment of depression. In this article, we report the design and protocol of a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in China to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in the prevention of relapse of depressive symptoms. In total, 540 patients, aged 18 to 60 years, diagnosed with depression and experiencing an acute exacerbation of depressive symptoms, will be enrolled. The study will consist of four phases: a screening/tolerability phase of up to 7 days; an open-label, flexible-dose lead-in phase of 8 weeks; an open-label, fixed-dose stabilization phase of 6 weeks; and a single-blind relapse prevention phase of 12 months. During the open-label phase, all patients will be treated with venlafaxine.

We describe the strategic decisions in the design of the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar CHOICE). This article outlines the key issues and solutions the investigators faced in designing a clinical trial that would maximize generalizability and inform real-world clinical treatment of bipolar disorder. Bipolar CHOICE was a 6-month, multi-site, prospective, randomized clinical trial of outpatients with bipolar disorder. This study compares the effectiveness of quetiapine versus lithium, each with adjunctive personalized treatments (APTs). The co-primary outcomes selected are the overall benefits and harms of the study medications (as measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy Index) and the Necessary Clinical Adjustments (a measure of the number of medication changes). Secondary outcomes are continuous measures of mood, the Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score, and the Longitudinal Interval Follow up Evaluation Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT). The final study design consisted of a single-blind, randomized comparative effectiveness trial of quetiapine versus lithium, plus APT, across 10 sites.

We describe the strategic decisions in the design of the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiative in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar CHOICE). This article outlines the key issues and solutions the investigators faced in designing a clinical trial that would maximize generalizability and inform real-world clinical treatment of bipolar disorder. Bipolar CHOICE was a 6-month, multi-site, prospective, randomized clinical trial of outpatients with bipolar disorder. This study compares the effectiveness of quetiapine versus lithium, each with adjunctive personalized treatments (APTs). The co-primary outcomes selected are the overall benefits and harms of the study medications (as measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy Index) and the Necessary Clinical Adjustments (a measure of the number of medication changes). Secondary outcomes are continuous measures of mood, the Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score, and the Longitudinal Interval Follow up Evaluation Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT). The final study design consisted of a single-blind, randomized comparative effectiveness trial of quetiapine versus lithium, plus APT, across 10 sites.

Finally, T-tests were used to compare the severity of factor scores between the PTSD sample and the baseline PANSS ratings from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial for Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia sample (n=1460). EFA suggested five factors similar to those identified in a summary of 29 schizophrenia studies by Wallwork (Schizophrenia Research, 137:246-250). CFA showed that the five factor Wallwork model fit the data better than the EFA, although both had relatively high goodness of fit. T-tests showed that the PTSD sample had more severe symptoms on the Depressive factor, and the schizophrenia sample on the Positive, Negative, and Disorganized factors, with no significant difference on the Excited factor. Veterans with PTSD had similar symptom structure to patients with schizophrenia on the PANSS, but were less symptomatic on psychosis-related factors and more symptomatic on depression. Dimensional symptom factors can be virtually the same across diagnoses.",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant
24606873,Pre-treatment predictors of attrition in a randomised controlled trial of psychological therapy for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa.,"Attrition is common in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and its causes are complex and incompletely understood. In particular, its relationship with adaptive function and motivational stage of change has been little studied. This study aimed to (1) investigate and (2) compare the strength of associations between adaptive function, stage of change and other previously found factors such as illness sub-type and treatment attrition in women with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SE-AN). Participants were 63 adult women with SE-AN of at least 7 years duration who were enrolled in a multi-site randomized controlled trial conducted from July 2007 through June 2011. Treatment comprised 30 outpatient visits over 8 months of either Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Anorexia Nervosa (CBT-AN) or Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM) both of which were modified for severe and enduring illness. Assessments were done at baseline, end of treatment, and 6 and 12 month post treatment follow-up. Demographic variables, duration of illness, specific and generic health related quality of life (QoL), eating disorder (ED) and mood disorder symptoms, social adjustment, body mass index (BMI), and motivation for change were assessed with interview and self-report questionnaires. Treatment attrition was defined as leaving therapy after either premature termination according to trial protocol or self-instigated discharge. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate relative strength of associations. Those who did not complete treatment were significantly more likely to have the purging sub-type of anorexia nervosa and poorer ED related QoL. There were no significant differences between attrition and which therapy was received, educational level, and global ED psychopathology, stage of change, BMI, social adjustment, duration of illness or level of depression. The strongest predictors on multivariable analysis were ED QoL and AN-purging subtype. This study supported previous findings of associations between attrition and purging subtype. Furthermore, we found associations between a potentially important cycle of attrition, and poorer EDQoL, which has not been previously reported. Contrary to expectations we did not find an association with BMI, severity of ED symptoms, low level of motivation to change ED features, or level of education.",BMC psychiatry,2014,10.1186/1471-244X-14-69,noncompliant,2010,2014,BMC psychiatry,Pre-treatment predictors of attrition in a randomised controlled trial of psychological therapy for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa.,"Attrition is common in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and its causes are complex and incompletely understood.

24712840,Allopurinol for mania: a randomized trial of allopurinol versus placebo as add-on treatment to mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotic agents in manic patients with bipolar disorder.,"An emerging body of evidence supports a role for dysfunctional purinergic neurotransmission in mood disorders. Adenosine agonists have been shown to have properties similar to those of dopamine antagonists; there is a well-characterized interaction between adenosine and dopamine receptors in the ventral striatum, and increasing adenosinergic transmission has been demonstrated to reduce the affinity of dopamine agonists for dopamine receptors. Allopurinol increases adenosine levels in the brain, and hence is hypothesized to reduce the symptoms of mania. Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials administering add-on allopurinol to manic patients showed significantly greater improvements in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores for drug compared to placebo, while a more recent, relatively small, add-on study showed negative results. Based on these data, our objective was to examine the efficacy of allopurinol as add-on treatment to mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotic agents in manic patients with bipolar disorder. We performed a large, well-powered, multicenter, six-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of allopurinol added to mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotic agents in 180 patients with bipolar disorder in an acute manic episode. Both groups showed improvement on the YMRS (effect size of 1.5 for placebo and 1.6 for allopurinol), with no difference observed between groups on YMRS scores (t = 0.28, p = 0.78).

No substantial side effects were recorded. The results of the present study indicate YKS to be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, particularly to improve excitement/hostility symptoms.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant
24934401,Fluoxetine for Autistic Behaviors (FAB trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial in children and adolescents with autism.,"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed off-label for children with autism. To date, clinical trials examining the use of SSRIs in autism have been limited by small sample sizes and inconclusive results. The efficacy and safety of SSRIs for moderating autistic behaviors is yet to be adequately examined to provide evidence to support current clinical practice. The aim of the Fluoxetine for Autistic Behaviors (FAB) study is to determine the efficacy and safety of low dose fluoxetine compared with placebo, for reducing the frequency and severity of repetitive stereotypic behaviors in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relationship between the effectiveness of fluoxetine treatment and serotonin transporter genotype will also be explored. The FAB study is a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, funded by the Australian Government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grant. Participants will be aged between 7.5 and 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. Eligible participants will be randomized to either placebo or fluoxetine for a 16-week period. Medication will be titrated over the first four weeks. Reponses to medication will be monitored fortnightly using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). The primary outcome measure is the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorders (CYBOCS-PDD), administered at baseline and 16 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include the Aberrant Behaviour Scale (ABC), the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale Parent Report (SCAS-P), and the Repetitive Behaviors Scale (RBS-R), measured at baseline and 16 weeks. Participants will be invited to undergo genetic testing for SLC6A4 allele variants using a cheek swab. Continuous outcomes, including the primary outcome will be compared between the active and placebo groups using unadjusted linear regression. Binary outcomes will be compared using unadjusted logistic regression. The FAB study is a large clinical trial to specifically investigate the efficacy of low dose fluoxetine for restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors in ASD. The outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based interventions used in clinical practice to assist children with ASD.

However, there is a need to improve access to therapeutic interventions. We aim to train frontline mental health staff to deliver brief, structured CBT-based therapies. We have developed and piloted a manualized intervention to support people with psychosis and anxious avoidance or depression to work towards a personal recovery goal. The 'GOALS Study' is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing usual care plus an 8-week intervention with usual care alone. The key objective is to assess clinical feasibility (recruitment and randomization; compliance with the treatment manual; acceptability and satisfaction; progress towards goals). A secondary objective is a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Sixty-six participants with a diagnosis of psychosis, plus symptoms of depression or anxiety will be recruited from adult mental health services. Those currently refusing medication, in receipt of CBT, or with a primary diagnosis of an organic mental health problem or substance dependency will be excluded. Following informed consent, randomization will be independent of the trial team, at a 50:50 ratio, at the level of the individual and stratified by main problem focus. Following randomization, participants allocated to the intervention group will begin the 8-week intervention with a local, trained member of staff, supervised by the study coordinator. Outcomes will be assessed blind to treatment condition at 0, 12 and 18 weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome measure for the efficacy analysis will be activity levels at 12 weeks.

24994555,"Efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in Chinese Han schizophrenia subjects: a randomized, double-blind, active parallel-controlled, multicenter clinical trial.","Antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole and risperidone, are often used to treat individuals with schizophrenia. The efficacy as well as safety of aripiprazole in Western populations has been described. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and risperidone in Chinese Han schizophrenia subjects in mainland China. The 6-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel study was conducted in 5 medical centers in mainland China from November 2007 to March 2011. A total of 279 subjects with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomly assigned (with a randomization ratio of 1:1) to aripiprazole (n=139) or risperidone (n=140). Efficacy measurements included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative and general psychopathology subscale scores, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Improvement scale scores. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, QTc interval, and self-reported adverse events were also assessed as measures of safety and tolerability. Both the aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed statistically significant improvement of PANSS total, positive, negative, general psychopathology subscale scores, and CGI-S scores from baseline to the endpoint (all p<0.01). Significant improvement was noted in the first week for both treatment groups. There were no significant differences in efficacy measurements between the two treatment groups. Mean change of PANSS total scores from baseline to the endpoint was -26.8±18.1 for aripiprazole and -30.0±17.7 for risperidone, (p=0.1475). The responder rate was 71% (n=99) and 76% (n=107) for aripiprazole and risperidone, respectively, (p=0.323).

However, the incidence of clinically significant weight gain (p=0.0118) and hyperprolactinemia (p<0.001) in the aripiprazole group was significantly lower than in the risperidone group. The study demonstrated that aripiprazole, as well as risperidone, had rapid and persistent efficacy for psychotic symptoms from the first week of therapy. There may be poor efficacy for aripiprazole compared with risperidone for overall improvement, but there were no significant differences in this study.

This multicenter, randomized, open-label study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), relative bioavailability, and tolerability of a single IM deltoid or gluteal injection of aripiprazole lauroxil in adult subjects with chronic stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Forty-six subjects were randomized 1:1 to aripiprazole lauroxil 441 mg IM in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Samples were collected through 89 days post-dose to measure levels of aripiprazole lauroxil, N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, aripiprazole, and dehydro-aripiprazole. Forty-three (93.5%) subjects completed all study assessments; most were CYP2D6 extensive or immediate metabolizers (96%); two (4%) were poor metabolizers. The PK of aripiprazole following aripiprazole lauroxil was characterized by a steady rise in plasma concentrations (Tmax 44-50 days), a broad peak, and prolonged exposure attributable to the dissolution of aripiprazole lauroxil and formation rate-limited elimination of aripiprazole (t1/2=15.4-19.2 days). Deltoid vs. gluteal administration resulted in slightly higher Cmax aripiprazole concentrations [1.31 (1.02, 1.67); GMR 90% CI]; total exposure (AUCinf) was similar between sites of administration [0.84 (0.57, 1.24)].

This multicenter, randomized, open-label study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), relative bioavailability, and tolerability of a single IM deltoid or gluteal injection of aripiprazole lauroxil in adult subjects with chronic stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Forty-six subjects were randomized 1:1 to aripiprazole lauroxil 441 mg IM in the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Samples were collected through 89 days post-dose to measure levels of aripiprazole lauroxil, N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, aripiprazole, and dehydro-aripiprazole. Forty-three (93.5%) subjects completed all study assessments; most were CYP2D6 extensive or immediate metabolizers (96%); two (4%) were poor metabolizers. The PK of aripiprazole following aripiprazole lauroxil was characterized by a steady rise in plasma concentrations (Tmax 44-50 days), a broad peak, and prolonged exposure attributable to the dissolution of aripiprazole lauroxil and formation rate-limited elimination of aripiprazole (t1/2=15.4-19.2 days). Deltoid vs. gluteal administration resulted in slightly higher Cmax aripiprazole concentrations [1.31 (1.02, 1.67); GMR 90% CI]; total exposure (AUCinf) was similar between sites of administration [0.84 (0.57, 1.24)]. N-hydroxymethyl-aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole exposures were 10% and 33-36%, respectively, of aripiprazole exposure following aripiprazole lauroxil. The most common adverse events were injection site pain in 20 subjects (43.5%) and headache in 6 subjects (13.0%) of mild intensity occurring at a similar rate with deltoid and gluteal administration.

Change from baseline in CGI-S scores was statistically significantly greater in both cariprazine groups compared with placebo (LSMD [95% CI]: 3-6 mg/d, -0.6 [-0.9 to -0.4]; 6-12 mg/d, -0.6 [-0.9 to -0.3]; P < .001 [both]). The most common (≥ 5% and twice the rate of placebo) treatment-related adverse events for cariprazine were akathisia (both groups) and nausea, constipation, and tremor (6-12 mg/d only). Results of this study demonstrated that both low- and high-dose cariprazine were more effective than placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Cariprazine was generally well tolerated, although the incidence of akathisia was greater with cariprazine than with placebo.

Data came from the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) effectiveness trial. Participants (N=1004) were randomized to an evidence-based anxiety intervention (including cognitive behavioral therapy and medications) or usual care in primary care. Participants completed measures of alcohol use, anxiety, and depression at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up periods. Patients with alcohol dependence were excluded. There were no significant moderating (Treatment Group × Alcohol Use Severity) interactions. The majority of analyses revealed no predictive effects of alcohol use severity on outcome; however, alcohol problems at baseline were associated with somewhat higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the 18-month follow-up. These data indicate that patients with alcohol problems in primary care can be effectively treated for anxiety disorders. Baseline alcohol problems were associated with some poorer long-term outcomes, but this was evident across CALM and usual care.

Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of internet-based programs for improving sexual functioning in the general population. The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in alleviating problems with sexuality and intimacy in women who have been treated for breast cancer. In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial we are evaluating the efficacy of an internet-based CBT program in reducing problems with sexuality and intimacy in breast cancer survivors. Secondary outcomes include body image, marital functioning, psychological distress, menopausal symptoms, and health-related quality of life. We will recruit 160 breast cancer survivors (aged 18-65 years) with a formal DSM-IV diagnosis of sexual dysfunction from general and academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Women are randomized to either an intervention or waiting-list control group. Self-report questionnaires are completed by the intervention group at baseline (T0), ten weeks after start of therapy (T1), post-treatment (T2), 3 months post-treatment (T3), and 9 months post-treatment (T4). The control group completes questionnaires at T0, T1 and T2. There is a need for accessible and effective interventions for the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in breast cancer survivors. This study will provide evidence about the efficacy of an internet-based approach to delivering a CBT intervention targeted specifically at these sexual health issues. If proven to be effective, internet-based CBT for problems with sexuality and intimacy will be a welcome addition to the care offered to breast cancer survivors. Hopefully this therapy will lower the barrier to seeking help for these problems, resulting in improved quality of life after breast cancer.

The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program in alleviating problems with sexuality and intimacy in women who have been treated for breast cancer. In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial we are evaluating the efficacy of an internet-based CBT program in reducing problems with sexuality and intimacy in breast cancer survivors. Secondary outcomes include body image, marital functioning, psychological distress, menopausal symptoms, and health-related quality of life. We will recruit 160 breast cancer survivors (aged 18-65 years) with a formal DSM-IV diagnosis of sexual dysfunction from general and academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Women are randomized to either an intervention or waiting-list control group. Self-report questionnaires are completed by the intervention group at baseline (T0), ten weeks after start of therapy (T1), post-treatment (T2), 3 months post-treatment (T3), and 9 months post-treatment (T4). The control group completes questionnaires at T0, T1 and T2. There is a need for accessible and effective interventions for the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in breast cancer survivors. This study will provide evidence about the efficacy of an internet-based approach to delivering a CBT intervention targeted specifically at these sexual health issues. If proven to be effective, internet-based CBT for problems with sexuality and intimacy will be a welcome addition to the care offered to breast cancer survivors. Hopefully this therapy will lower the barrier to seeking help for these problems, resulting in improved quality of life after breast cancer.

The PRIDE study is a 15-month, randomized, multicenter study (May 5, 2010, to December 9, 2013) of adult subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia and a history of incarceration. Subjects were randomly assigned to once-monthly paliperidone palmitate injections or daily oral antipsychotics (randomly assigned from 7 acceptable, prespecified oral antipsychotics) for 15 months. The primary end point was time to first treatment failure, defined as arrest/incarceration; psychiatric hospitalization; suicide; treatment discontinuation or supplementation due to inadequate efficacy, safety, or tolerability; or increased psychiatric services to prevent hospitalization. Time to first treatment failure was determined by a blinded event-monitoring board and analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. In this study, 450 patients were randomly assigned, and 444 were included in the intent-to-treat population.

26122891,Frequency and change mechanisms of psychotherapy among depressed patients: study protocol for a multicenter randomized trial comparing twice-weekly versus once-weekly sessions of CBT and IPT.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are among the most well established therapies for the treatment of depression. However, some major questions remain unanswered. First, it is unknown what session frequency results in the most optimal (cost) effectiveness in psychotherapy. Second, the debate as to what mechanisms underlie the effect of psychotherapy has not yet been resolved. Enhancing knowledge about the optimal session frequency and mechanisms of change seems crucial in order to optimize the (cost) effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression. This study aims to compare treatment outcome of twice-weekly versus once-weekly sessions of CBT and IPT. We expect twice-weekly sessions to be more effective and lead to more rapid recovery of depressive symptoms in comparison to once-weekly sessions. Both therapy-specific and non-specific process measures will be included to unravel the mechanisms of change in psychotherapy for depression. Besides the use of self-reports and behavioral observations, this study will also examine underlying biological processes by collecting blood samples. In a multicenter randomized trial, two hundred depressed patients will be recruited from Dutch specialized mental healthcare centers and randomized into one of the following groups, all receiving a maximum of 20 sessions in different frequencies: a) twice-weekly sessions at the start of CBT, b) twice-weekly sessions at the start of IPT, c) once-weekly sessions at the start of CBT, d) once-weekly sessions at the start of IPT. Primary outcome measures are depression severity, cost-effectiveness and quality of life. Process measures include therapeutic alliance, recall, therapy-specific skills, motivation and compliance. Assessments will take place during baseline, monthly during treatment and follow-up at month 9, 12 and 24. In addition, at 12 and 24 months, the frequency of depressive episodes in the previous year will be assessed. Blood samples will be taken pre- and post-treatment. The study has been ethically approved and registered. Finding that twice-weekly sessions are more effective or lead to more rapid recovery of depressive symptoms could lead to treatment adaptations that have the potential to reduce the personal and societal burden of depression. In addition, insight into the mechanisms of change and physiological processes in psychotherapy will enable us to optimize treatments and may help to understand human functioning beyond the context of treatment.

The scores of TSQM effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction as well as the PSP total score increased significantly, whereas the PANSS total score decreased significantly in both groups. The immediate switch group showed a significant improvement in the TSQM convenience score compared with the delayed switch group on oral antipsychotics during the comparison period. Most adverse events were minor and tolerable. In short, switching from oral atypical antipsychotics to paliperidone palmitate because of poor satisfaction significantly improved patient satisfaction, with comparable efficacy and tolerability.",False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,compliant

Sixty individuals with cancer diagnosed in the previous 6 months and receiving treatment with curative intent were randomised to receive either the 6-week intervention Cancer Coping Online (CCO: n = 30) or the 6-week Web-based attention control (n = 30). Outcome measures, including cancer distress (the Posttraumatic Stress Scale - Self-Report), general distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), and coping (mini-MAC), were administered at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Significant main effects for time were found for cancer distress, global QOL, physical function, role function, social function, and anxious preoccupation. Post hoc between-group comparisons showed CCO participants had statistically significantly higher physical functioning compared to controls at 3 months of follow-up (d = -0.52, p = 0.02). Furthermore, compared to controls, post hoc comparisons found moderate between-group effect sizes favouring CCO post-intervention for cancer distress (d = 0.43) and anxious preoccupation (d = 0.38), and at 6 months of follow-up for global QOL (d = -0.43).

The mean (SD) estimated difference in IDS-C scores between baseline (35.4 [10.7] for sertraline; 32.8 [10.4] for placebo) and the end point (15.3 [10.7] for sertraline; 17.8 [11.0] for placebo) favored the sertraline group by 5.14 (95% CI, 1.97-8.31) points (P = .02). Compared with the placebo group, those assigned to sertraline showed greater improvement on the total DRSP score (estimated mean difference, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.96-1.25] points; P = .02) and Anger/Irritability DRSP subscale score (1.22 [95% CI, 1.05-1.41] points; P < .01) and were more likely to respond to treatment (77 of 115 patients [67.0%] for sertraline and 65 of 124 [52.4%] for placebo; χ21 = 5.23; P = .02). The mean (SD) number of symptomatic days before treatment diminished over time (sertraline, -0.7 [3.4] days; placebo, -1.0 [3.2] days), with no group differences in symptomatic days or the Michelson SSRI Withdrawal Symptoms Scale. Depending on the symptom scale, women with PMDD may or may not benefit from SRI treatment during the interval from the onset of premenstrual symptoms through the first few days of menses.

Proof-of-concept trials indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has the potential to improve cognitive functioning. We analyzed the effects of 10-Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia in a large-scale and multicenter, sham-controlled study. A total of 156 schizophrenia patients with predominant negative symptoms were randomly assigned to a 3-week intervention (10-Hz rTMS, 15 sessions, 1000 stimuli per session) with either active or sham rTMS. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test A and B, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Digit Span Test, and the Regensburg Word Fluency Test were administered before intervention and at day 21, 45, and 105 follow-up. From the test results, a neuropsychological composite score was computed. Both groups showed no differences in any of the outcome variables before and after intervention. Both groups improved markedly over time, but effect sizes indicate a numeric, but nonsignificant superiority of active rTMS in certain cognitive tests.

Objectives We investigated the association between EEG abnormalities and antidepressant treatment response in the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D). Methods Of 1008 participants with major depressive disorder randomized to escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR, 622 completed 8 weeks of treatment per protocol. The study also recruited 336 healthy controls. Treatment response was established after 8 weeks using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The resting-state EEG was assessed at baseline with eyes closed. EEG abnormalities including epileptiform activity, EEG slowing, and alpha peak frequency (APF) were scored for all subjects, blind to treatment outcome.

The authors assessed the heterogeneity of response to citalopram in the Citalopram for Agitation in Alzheimer Disease (CitAD) study to identify individuals who may be helped or harmed. In this double-blind parallel-group multicenter trial of 186 patients with Alzheimer's disease and clinically significant agitation, participants were randomly assigned to receive citalopram or placebo for 9 weeks, with the dosage titrated to 30 mg/day over the first 3 weeks. Five planned potential predictors of treatment outcome were assessed, along with six additional predictors. The authors then used a two-stage multivariate method to select the most likely predictors; grouped participants into 10 subgroups by their index scores; and estimated the citalopram treatment effect for each. Five covariates were likely predictors, and treatment effect was heterogeneous across the subgroups. Patients for whom citalopram was more effective were more likely to be outpatients, have the least cognitive impairment, have moderate agitation, and be within the middle age range (76-82 years). Patients for whom placebo was more effective were more likely to be in long-term care, have more severe cognitive impairment, have more severe agitation, and be treated with lorazepam. Considering several covariates together allowed the identification of responders. Those with moderate agitation and with lower levels of cognitive impairment were more likely to benefit from citalopram, and those with more severe agitation and greater cognitive impairment were at greater risk for adverse responses.

RBP-7000 produced statistically and clinically significant differences in mean reductions from baseline in PANSS total scores (90-mg RBP-7000 compared with placebo, -6.148 [-9.982 to -2.314], P = 0.0004; 120-mg RBP-7000 compared with placebo, -7.237 [-11.045 to -3.429], P < 0.0001) and significantly improved Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores (90-mg RBP-7000 compared with placebo, -0.350 [-0.557 to -0.143], P = 0.0002; 120-mg RBP-7000 compared with placebo, -0.396 [-0.602 to -0.190], P < 0.0001). Both RBP-7000 dosages were generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events in RBP-7000 groups compared with placebo were somnolence, weight gain, and akathisia. The overall incidence of extrapyramidal syndrome-related effects was low and similar across groups. RBP-7000 may provide a new, long-acting alternative treatment for use in adults with acute schizophrenia.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant
26890894,Sleep disturbance in chronic military-related PTSD: clinical impact and response to adjunctive risperidone in the Veterans Affairs cooperative study #504.,"Sleep disturbances are common among veterans with chronic military-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This article reports the results of a multicenter clinical trial that explored the clinical correlates of reported sleep impairment in these veterans and tested the impact of the second-generation antipsychotic risperidone upon these symptoms. This article reports secondary analyses of a 24-week multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive risperidone in patients with chronic military-related PTSD symptoms (n = 267, 97% male) who were symptomatic despite treatment with antidepressants and other medications. The study was conducted between February 2007 and February 2010. DSM-IV PTSD diagnoses were made by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Nonpatient Edition. Sleep disturbances were assessed principally by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (primary outcome measure). Analyses were conducted using bivariate correlations and longitudinal mixed model regressions. Eighty-eight percent of the patients in this study had clinically significantly impaired sleep on the PSQI. Severity of sleep disturbances correlated with PTSD symptom severity as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and reductions in multiple measures of quality of life (Veterans RAND 36-item Health Survey [SF-36 V] subscales, Boston Life Satisfaction Index). Risperidone produced small but statistically significant effects on total PSQI scores (main effect of drug: F1,228 = 4.57, P = .034; drug-by-time interaction: F2,421 = 4.32, P = .014) and severity of nightmares as assessed by the CAPS (main effect of drug: F1,248 = 4.60, P = .033). The improvements in sleep quality produced by risperidone correlated with reductions in PTSD symptom severity and improvement in the mental health subscale of the SF-36 V. This study highlighted the near universality and significant negative impact of severe disturbances in sleep quality in veterans with chronic military-related PTSD who were partial responders to standard pharmacotherapies. The modest improvements in sleep quality produced by adjunctive risperidone were correlated with limited reductions in PTSD severity and improvements in quality of life.

The study purpose is to assess the effects of a web-based psychosocial relapse prevention program with a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Recruitment began in January 2015 for outpatient participants diagnosed with drug abuse or dependence who have used a primary abused drug in the past year at psychiatric hospitals and a clinic. Participants are randomized either to a web-based relapse prevention program or a self-monitoring group. The intervention is a web-based relapse prevention program named ""e-SMARPP"" that consists of six relapse prevention program modules with tailored feedback from health care professionals and 8 weeks of self-monitoring. The content is adapted from a face-to-face relapse prevention program which is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement. The primary outcomes are relapse risk assessed by the Stimulant Relapse Risk Scale (baseline, 2-, 5- and 8-month) and the longest duration of consecutive abstinent days from primary abused drug during the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include motivation to change, self-efficacy for drug use and craving, abstinent days in the past 28 or 56 days, quality of life, sense of coherence, cost of substance use, medical cost, retention of treatment and use of self-help group.

In 97 children with a mean of 22.9 ± 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 ± 3.4 kg weight gain over 24 weeks (p < .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 ± 10.4 cm to 66.8 ± 11.3 cm (p < .0001). At baseline, 59 of 97 children (60.8%) were classified as having normal weight; by week 24, only 25 of 85 (29.4%) remained in that group. Growth curve analysis showed a significant change in body mass index (BMI) z scores from pretreatment to week 24 (p < .0001). This effect was significantly greater for children with reported increased appetite in the first 8 weeks. From before treatment to week 16, there were significant increases in glucose (p = .02), hemoglobin A1c (p = .01), insulin (p <.0001), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p < .001), alanine aminotransferase (p = .01), and leptin (p < .0001).

In this multicenter trial, we examine the magnitude of DCS augmentation effects for an ultra-brief program of CBT. We conducted a double-blind, controlled trial at three treatment sites, randomizing 180 adults with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder to five sessions of treatment, with study pill (50 mg DCS or matching placebo) administered 1 hr prior to the final three sessions. Two booster sessions were subsequently provided, and outcome was assessed at posttreatment and 1-month, 2-month, and 6-month follow-up assessments. The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale. Additional analyses examined the role of severity and current antidepressant or benzodiazepine use as moderators of DCS augmentation effects. DCS augmentation resulted in significant benefit only early in the trial, with no beneficial effects of DCS augmentation evident at follow-up evaluations. We did not find that baseline severity or antidepressant or benzodiazepine use moderated DCS efficacy, but benzodiazepine use was associated with lower efficacy of CBT regardless of augmentation condition. Consistent with other recent multicenter trials, the benefit of DCS was less than indicated by pilot study and reflected an acceleration of treatment response evident at treatment endpoint, but no advantage in response over follow-up evaluation.

Multicenter, three-arm, parallel, RCT design, carried out between November 2012 and January 2014, with a follow-up of 15 months. In total, 296 adults from primary care settings in four Spanish regions, with mild or moderate major depression, were randomized to LITG (n=96), CSG (n=98), or iTAU (n=102). Research completers at follow-up were 63.5%. The intervention was Smiling is Fun, an Internet program based on cognitive behavioral therapy. All patients received iTAU by their general practitioners.

27569526,Multisite prediction of 4-week and 52-week treatment outcomes in patients with first-episode psychosis: a machine learning approach.,"At present, no tools exist to estimate objectively the risk of poor treatment outcomes in patients with first-episode psychosis. Such tools could improve treatment by informing clinical decision-making before the commencement of treatment. We tested whether such a tool could be successfully built and validated using routinely available, patient-reportable information. By applying machine learning to data from 334 patients in the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform number, ISRCTN68736636), we developed a tool to predict poor versus good treatment outcome (Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] score ≥65 vs GAF <65, respectively) after 4 weeks and 52 weeks of treatment. To enable the unbiased estimation of the predictive system's generalisability to new patients, we used repeated nested cross-validation to prevent information leaking between patients used for training and validating the models. In pursuit of everyday clinical applicability, we retrained the 4-week outcome predictor with only the top ten predictors of the pooled prediction system and then tested this tool in 108 independent patients with 4-week outcome labels. Discontinuation and readmission to hospital events in patients with predicted poor versus good outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier log-rank analyses, whereas generalised linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate the GAF-based predictions against several clinically meaningful outcome indicators, including treatment adherence, symptom remission, and quality of life. The generalisability of our outcome predictions were estimated with cross-validation (test-fold balanced accuracy [BAC] of 75·0% for 4-week outcomes and 73·8% for and 52-week outcomes), and leave-site-out validation across 44 European sites (BAC of 72·1% for 4-week outcomes and 71·1% for 52-week outcomes). We identified a smaller group of ten predictors still providing a BAC of 71·7% in 108 patients never used for model discovery. Unemployment, poor education, functional deficits, and unmet psychosocial needs predicted both endpoints, whereas previous depressive episodes, male sex, and suicidality additionally predicted poor 1-year outcomes. 52-week predictions identified patients at risk for symptom persistence, non-adherence to treatment, readmission to hospital and poor quality of life. Specifically among these patients, amisulpride and olanzapine showed superior efficacy versus haloperidol, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. Our results suggest that prognostic models operating on brief, patient-reportable pre-treatment data might provide useful insight into individualised outcome trajectories, optimising treatment selection, and targeted clinical trial designs.

27629871,N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in schizophrenia resistant to clozapine: a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial targeting negative symptoms.,"Clozapine is an effective treatment for a proportion of people with schizophrenia (SZ) who are resistant to the beneficial effects of other antipsychotic drugs. However, anything from 40-60 % of people on clozapine experience residual symptoms even on adequate doses of the medication, and thus could be considered 'clozapine resistant'. Agents that could work alongside clozapine to improve efficacy whilst not increasing the adverse effect burden are both desired and necessary to improve the lives of individuals with clozapine-resistant SZ. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is one such possible agent. Previous research from our research group provided promising pilot data suggesting the efficacy of NAC in this patient population. The aim of the study reported here is to expand this work by conducting a large scale clinical trial of NAC in the treatment of clozapine-resistant SZ. This study is an investigator initiated, multi-site, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. It aims to include 168 patients with clozapine-resistant SZ, divided into an intervention group (NAC) and a control group (placebo). Participants in the intervention group will receive 2 g daily of NAC. The primary outcome measures will be the negative symptom scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary outcome measures will include: changes in quality of life (QoL) as measured by the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP) and cognitive functioning as measured by the total score on the MATRICS. Additionally we will examine peripheral and cortical glutathione (GSH) concentrations as process outcomes. This large scale clinical trial will investigate the efficacy of NAC as an adjunctive medication to clozapine. This trial, if successful, will establish a cheap, safe and easy-to-use agent (NAC) as a 'go to' adjunct in patients that are only partly responsive to clozapine.

Patients with PD and depression were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group study of real or realistic (electric) sham rTMS. Patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: bilateral M1 ( + sham dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]), DLPFC ( + sham M1), M1 + DLPFC, or double sham. The TMS course consisted of 10 daily sessions of 2,000 stimuli for the left DLPFC and 1,000 stimuli for each M1 (50 × 4-second trains of 40 stimuli at 10 Hz). Patients were evaluated at baseline, at 1 week, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Primary endpoints were changes in motor function assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III and in mood with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 1 month. Of the 160 patients planned for recruitment, 85 were screened, 61 were randomized, and 50 completed all study visits. Real M1 rTMS resulted in greater improvement in motor function than sham at the primary endpoint (p < 0.05). There was no improvement in mood in the DLPFC group compared to the double-sham group, as well as no benefit to combining M1 and DLPFC stimulation for either motor or mood symptoms. In patients with PD with depression, M1 rTMS is an effective treatment of motor symptoms, while mood benefit after 2 weeks of DLPFC rTMS is not better than sham.

A Report from the TRIAD Study.,"To determine if patients with childhood onsets (CO) of both major depression and insomnia disorder show blunted depression and insomnia treatment responses to concurrent interventions for both disorders compared to those with adult onsets (AO) of both conditions. This study was a secondary analysis of data obtained from a multisite randomized clinical trial designed to test the efficacy of combining a psychological/behavior insomnia therapy with antidepressant medication to enhance depression treatment outcomes in patients with comorbid major depression and insomnia. This study included 27 adults with CO of depression and insomnia and 77 adults with AO of both conditions. They underwent a 16-week treatment including: (1) a standardized two-step pharmacotherapy for depression algorithm, consisting of escitalopram, sertraline, and desvenlafaxine in a prescribed sequence; and (2) either cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT-I) or a quasi-desensitization control (CTRL) therapy. Main outcome measures were the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) completed pre-treatment and every 2 weeks thereafter. The AO and CO groups did not differ significantly in regard to their pre-treatment HRSD-17 and ISI scores. Mixed model analyses that adjusted for the number of insomnia treatment sessions attended showed that the AO group achieved significantly lower, subclinical scores on the HRSD-17 and ISI than did the CO group by the time of study exit. Moreover, a significant group by treatment arm interaction suggested that HRSD-17 scores at study exit remained significantly higher in the CO group receiving the CTRL therapy than was the case for the participants in the CO group receiving CBT-I.

Enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-E) has been described and put to the test as a transdiagnostic treatment protocol for all EDs, including EDNOS. Initial research in the UK suggests that CBT-E is more effective for EDs, especially bulimia nervosa (BN) and EDNOS, than the earlier version of CBT. These positive results of CBT-E have to be replicated in more detail, preferably by independent researchers in different countries. Being the first Dutch study into CBT-E, the results from this national multicenter study - on three sites specialized in EDs - will deliver important information about the effectiveness of CBT-E in several domains of ED pathology, while providing input for the upcoming update of the Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline for the Treatment of Eating Disorders. A multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted. One hundred and thirty-two adult outpatients (aged 18 years and older) with an ED diagnosis and a Body Mass index (BMI) of between 17.5 and 40 will be randomly allocated to the control or the intervention group. Subjects in the control group will receive Treatment as Usual (standard outpatient treatment provided at the participating sites). Subjects in the intervention group will receive 20 sessions of CBT-E in 20 weeks. The design is a 2 (group) × 5 (time) repeated measures factorial design in which neither therapists nor patients will be blinded for treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure is recovery from the ED. Secondary outcome measures include ED psychopathology, common mental disorders, anxiety and depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, health care use and productivity loss. Self-esteem, perfectionism and interpersonal problems will be examined as putative predictors and mediators of the effect of treatment. Also, an economic evaluation from a societal perspective will be undertaken. All relevant effects, direct and indirect costs will be included. Utility scores will measure the effects. Measurements will take place at pretreatment, 6 weeks, 20 weeks, 40 weeks and 80 weeks. This effectiveness study into CBT-E has the aim of broadening the scope and generalizability of former studies. If CBT-E appears to be at least as effective as traditional diagnosis-specific treatments for a broad range of ED patients, training in one protocol would be sufficient for clinicians to treat patients with different kinds of EDs.

Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are two primary interventions for the standardized treatment of MDD. However, their weaknesses, such as a low response rate, a high risk of adverse events from medication, and the high cost of cognitive behavioral therapy, have resulted in a need for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Among the various therapeutic interventions in CAM, electroacupuncture and moxibustion have been widely used to treat various mental illnesses, including MDD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture plus moxibustion therapy for MDD. We will include patients between the ages of 19 to 65 years with MDD. A total of 30 participants will be recruited, and they will be randomly allocated into two groups at a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the treatment and control groups will, respectively, receive real and sham electroacupuncture/moxibustion treatments, for a total of 20 sessions over 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the secondary outcomes will be Beck's Depression Inventory, the Insomnia Severity Index, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the EuroQol 5-Dimension Index, the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile version 2, and electroencephalography.

Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback messages after each module. A total of 406 patients with chronic back pain and without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary patient-relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of MDD measured by the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) at baseline and 1-year post-randomization. Key secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, depression severity, pain intensity, pain-related disability, ability to work, intervention satisfaction and adherence as well as side effects of the intervention. Online assessments take place at baseline and 9 weeks as well as 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Cox regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at 12-month follow-up. Moreover, an economic analysis will be conducted from a societal and public health perspective. This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention in a sample of chronic pain patients. If this implementation of a depression prevention IMI into orthopedic aftercare proves effective, the intervention could be integrated into routine care with minimal costs and extended for use with other chronic diseases.

Multiple linear regression models identified features associated with placebo response and models were confirmed with leave-one-out cross-validation. The likelihood of improvement in patients receiving pill placebo-over time-relative to improvement associated with active treatment was determined using probabilistic Bayesian analyses.

This multicenter study assessed whether raloxifene plus antipsychotic treatment, in comparison to placebo plus antipsychotics, improves symptoms or cognition in severely ill decompensated schizophrenia patients. In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 200 severely ill, decompensated postmenopausal women who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were recruited from January 2011 to December 2012 and were randomized to receive either raloxifene 120 mg/d plus antipsychotics or placebo plus antipsychotics. The primary outcome measure was Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at the end of the trial. The placebo plus antipsychotics group experienced statistically significant improvement in PANSS total score (P < .001) compared to the raloxifene plus antipsychotics group, using mixed models for repeated measures, with results favoring placebo by 4.5 points (95% CI, 2.3-6.7). These results were clearly outside the 95% confidence interval. This negative effect was more pronounced in patients who had more frequent relapses and in those with baseline PANSS scores of 100 or higher. There were no differences between groups in Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity scores or Composite Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia scores at 16 weeks (P > .3).

A Relapse Comparison in Schizophrenia With 3 Different Formulations of Paliperidone.,"To evaluate the effect of 1 oral and 2 distinct long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of the same antipsychotic on times to relapse following medication discontinuation. Data were drawn from 3 similarly designed, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal studies of paliperidone in adults with a schizophrenia diagnosis (according to DSM-IV criteria for ≥ 1 year before screening): once-daily extended-release oral paliperidone (ORAL paliperidone), once-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP1M), and once-every-3-months paliperidone palmitate (PP3M). In a post hoc analysis, we compared median time to relapse across the treatment-withdrawal arms of the 3 studies using final analysis datasets. Time to relapse in the withdrawal arm of each study was examined using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models. Four hundred forty-nine patients were withdrawn from 3 paliperidone formulations: 101 from ORAL paliperidone, 203 from PP1M, and 145 from PP3M. Postwithdrawal median (95% confidence interval [CI]) days to relapse were 58 days (42-114 days) for ORAL paliperidone, 172 days (134-222 days) for PP1M, and 395 days (274 days-not reached) for PP3M (P < .0001, pairwise comparisons). Relapse risk was significantly lower (P < .001) for patients who withdrew from either PP formulation relative to ORAL paliperidone and additionally for patients who withdrew from PP3M relative to PP1M. Results demonstrate that 50% of patients who withdrew treatment from ORAL paliperidone, PP1M, or PP3M remained relapse free for approximately 2 months, 6 months, and 13 months, respectively. This may be relevant for risk mitigation strategies in schizophrenia, a condition in which interruptions in maintenance antipsychotic treatment are commonplace and unpredictable.

However, before a decision can be made about implementation, the cost-effectiveness of this program should be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of stepped-care versus usual care within low vision rehabilitation. An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Data were collected by masked assessors during 24 months. Included were 265 older adults with vision impairment and subthreshold depression and/or anxiety. They were randomly assigned to stepped-care plus usual care (n = 131) or usual care alone (n = 134). Stepped-care comprised 1) watchful waiting, 2) guided self-help based on cognitive behavioral therapy, 3) problem solving treatment, and 4) referral to a general practitioner. Costs were based on direct healthcare costs and indirect non-healthcare costs. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the cumulative incidence of major depressive, dysthymic and/or anxiety disorders. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety. Based on intention-to-treat, significant differences were found in the incidence of depressive/anxiety disorders (mean difference 0.17; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29) and symptoms of anxiety (mean difference 1.43, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.77) in favor of stepped-care versus usual care; no significant difference was found for QALYs and symptoms of depression. Societal costs were non-significantly lower in the stepped-care group compared with the usual care group (mean difference: -€877; 95% confidence interval (CI): -8039 to 5489). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness was 95% or more at a willingness-to-pay of €33,000 per disorder prevented. The probability that stepped-care was cost-effective compared to usual care was 59% or more for a ceiling ratio of 0 €/QALY and increased to 65% at 20000 €/QALY. This economic evaluation shows that stepped-care is dominant to usual care, with a probability of around 60%, due to its clinical superiority and its modest cost savings. However, it depends on the willingness-to-pay of decision makers whether or not stepped-care is considered cost-effective compared with usual care. identifier: NTR3296 , date: 13-02-2012.",BMC psychiatry,2017,10.1186/s12888-017-1437-5,noncompliant,2010,2017,BMC psychiatry,Economic evaluation of stepped-care versus usual care for depression and anxiety in older adults with vision impairment: randomized controlled trial.,"A stepped-care program was found effective in preventing depressive and anxiety disorders in older adults with vision impairment.

Clinical endpoints included time to hospitalization and persistence on assigned medication. Weight, laboratory tests, psychopathology, neurologic side effects, social adjustment and role functioning were assessed at 3-6 month intervals.

29101095,Smartphone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as an Adjunct to Pharmacotherapy for Refractory Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"In the treatment of major depression, antidepressants are effective but not curative. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, but accessibility is a problem. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT app as adjunctive therapy among patients with antidepressant-resistant major depression. A multisite, assessor-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 psychiatric clinics and hospitals in Japan. Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression and were antidepressant-refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1-week run-in in which participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone app, called Kokoro-app (""kokoro"" means ""mind"" in Japanese), included sessions on self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by cartoon characters. The primary outcome was depression severity as assessed by masked telephone assessors with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at week 9. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER). In the total sample (N=164), 81 participants were allocated to the smartphone CBT in addition to medication change and 83 to medication change alone. In the former group, all but one participant (80/81, 99%) completed at least half, and 71 (88%) completed at least six of eight sessions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients allocated the CBT app scored 2.48 points (95% CI 1.23-3.72, P<.001; standardized mean difference 0.40) lower on PHQ-9 than the control at week 9. The former group also scored 4.1 points (95% CI 1.5-6.6, P=.002) lower on BDI-II and 0.76 points (95% CI -0.05 to 1.58, P=.07) lower on FIBSER. In the per-protocol sample (comfortable with the smartphone app, still symptomatic, and adherent to medication with mild or less side effects after run-in), the intervention group (n=60) scored 1.72 points (95% CI 0.25-3.18, P=.02) lower on PHQ-9, 3.2 points (95% CI -0.01 to 6.3, P=.05) lower on BDI-II, and 0.75 points (95% CI 0.03-1.47, P=.04) lower on FIBSER than the control (n=57). The treatment benefits were maintained up to week 17. This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT in the treatment of clinically diagnosed depression.

We analyzed data from a multicenter, double-blind trial that evaluated the efficacy of antidepressants on symptoms of FD, from October 2006 through October 2012. Patients (n = 292) were randomly assigned to groups given 50 mg amitriptyline, 10 mg escitalopram, or placebo for 12 weeks.

Baseline scores for the psychological and sleep measures were similar among groups; after 12 weeks there were no significant differences in scores among groups. Baseline mean global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores indicated poor sleep quality in all groups at baseline and after 12 weeks.

After 6 weeks of treatment, compared with the placebo group, the CBD group had lower levels of positive psychotic symptoms (PANSS: treatment difference=-1.4, 95% CI=-2.5, -0.2) and were more likely to have been rated as improved (CGI-I: treatment difference=-0.5, 95% CI=-0.8, -0.1) and as not severely unwell (CGI-S: treatment difference=-0.3, 95% CI=-0.5, 0.0) by the treating clinician. Patients who received CBD also showed greater improvements that fell short of statistical significance in cognitive performance (BACS: treatment difference=1.31, 95% CI=-0.10, 2.72) and in overall functioning (GAF: treatment difference=3.0, 95% CI=-0.4, 6.4). CBD was well tolerated, and rates of adverse events were similar between the CBD and placebo groups. These findings suggest that CBD has beneficial effects in patients with schizophrenia. As CBD's effects do not appear to depend on dopamine receptor antagonism, this agent may represent a new class of treatment for the disorder.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

Women aged 45 to 60 years, having 10 or more problematic HFNS a week, were recruited to a multicenter randomized controlled trial, via the occupational health/human resources departments of eight organizations. Participants were 1:1 randomized to SH-CBT or no treatment waitlist control (NTWC). The primary outcome was HFNS problem rating; secondary outcomes included HFNS frequency, work and social adjustment, sleep, mood, beliefs and behaviors, and work-related variables (absence, performance, turnover intention, and work impairment due to presenteeism). Intention-to-treat analysis was used, and between-group differences estimated using linear mixed models. A total of 124 women were randomly allocated to SH-CBT (n = 60) and NTWC (n = 64). 104 (84%) were assessed for primary outcome at 6 weeks and 102 (82%) at 20 weeks. SH-CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 6 weeks (SH-CBT vs NTWC adjusted mean difference, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.11 to -0.86; P < 0.001) and at 20 weeks (-1.09; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.31; P < 0.01). SH-CBT also significantly reduced HFNS frequency, improved work and social adjustment; sleep, menopause beliefs, HFNS beliefs/behaviors at 6 and 20 weeks; improved wellbeing and somatic symptoms and reduced work impairment due to menopause-related presenteeism at 20 weeks, compared with the NTWC.

29503163,Five novel loci associated with antipsychotic treatment response in patients with schizophrenia: a genome-wide association study.,"Antipsychotic drugs improve schizophrenia symptoms and reduce the frequency of relapse, but treatment response is highly variable. Little is known about the genetic factors associated with treatment response. We did a genome-wide association study of antipsychotic treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. The discovery cohort comprised patients with schizophrenia from 32 psychiatric hospitals in China that are part of the Chinese Antipsychotics Pharmacogenomics Consortium. Patients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to six groups (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and haloperidol or perphenazine; those assigned to haloperidol or perphenazine were subsequently assigned [1:1] to one or the other) for 6 weeks. Antipsychotic response was quantified with percentage change on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for their association with treatment response. Linkage-disequilibrium-independent SNPs that exhibited potential associations (ie, p<1 × 10) were tested in a validation cohort comprising patients from the Chinese Antipsychotics Pharmacogenetics Consortium from five collaborative hospitals, who were treated with olanzapine, risperidone, or aripiprazole for 8 weeks. The discovery cohort contained 2413 patients and the validation cohort 1379 patients. In the discovery cohort, we identified three novel SNPs (rs72790443 in MEGF10 [p=1·37 × 10], rs1471786 in SLC1A1 [p=1·77 × 10], and rs9291547 in PCDH7 [p=4·48 × 10]) that were associated with antipsychotic treatment response at a genome-wide significance level. These associations were confirmed in the validation cohort (p<0·05). In the combined sample of the discovery and validation cohorts, we identified five novel loci showing genome-wide significant associations with general antipsychotic treatment response (rs72790443 in MEGF10 [p=1·40 × 10], rs1471786 in SLC1A1 [p=2·33 × 10], rs9291547 in PCDH7 [p=3·24 × 10], rs12711680 in CNTNAP5 [p=2·12 × 10], and rs6444970 in TNIK [p=4·85 × 10]). In antipsychotic-specific groups, after the combination of results from both samples, the rs2239063 SNP in CACNA1C was associated with treatment response to olanzapine (p=1·10 × 10), rs16921385 in SLC1A1 was associated with treatment response to risperidone (p=4·40 × 10), and rs17022006 in CNTN4 was associated with treatment response to aripiprazole (p=2·58 × 10).

Although several clinical and demographic variables have been found to predict poor antidepressant response, these markers have not been robustly replicated to warrant implementation in clinical care. Increased pretreatment rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) theta activity has been linked to better antidepressant outcomes. However, no prior study has evaluated whether this marker has incremental predictive validity over clinical and demographic measures. To determine whether increased pretreatment rACC theta activity would predict symptom improvement regardless of randomization arm. A multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolled outpatients without psychosis and with chronic or recurrent MDD between July 29, 2011, and December 15, 2015 (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care [EMBARC]). Patients were consecutively recruited from 4 university hospitals: 634 patients were screened, 296 were randomized to receive sertraline hydrochloride or placebo, 266 had electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and 248 had usable EEG data. Resting EEG data were recorded at baseline and 1 week after trial onset, and rACC theta activity was extracted using source localization. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted.

29898692,The implementation and adherence to evidence-based protocols for psychotherapy for depression: the perspective of therapists in Dutch specialized mental healthcare.,"Although psychotherapy is an effective treatment for depression, a large number of patients still do not receive care according to the protocols that are used in clinical trials. Instead, patients often receive a modified version of the original intervention. It is not clear how and when treatment protocols are used or modified in the Dutch specialized mental health care and whether these changes lead to suboptimal adherence to treatment protocols. In the context of an ongoing multicenter trial that investigates whether twice-weekly sessions of protocolized interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression lead to better treatment outcomes compared to once-weekly sessions, two focus groups using semi-structured interviews were organized. Aims were to increase insight in the adherence to and modifications of CBT and IPT protocols in the Dutch specialized mental health care for depression. Participants were fifteen therapists from seven mental health locations part of five mental health organizations. Verbatim transcripts were coded and analyzed using qualitative software. Three themes emerged: modification as the common practice, professional and patient factors influencing the adherence to protocols and organizational boundaries and flexibility. Treatment modification appeared to happen on a frequent basis, even in the context of a trial. Definitions of treatment modifications were multiple and varied from using intuition to flexible use of the same protocol. Therapist training and supervision, the years of work experience and individual characteristics of the therapist and the patient were mentioned to influence the adherence to protocols.

Instead, patients often receive a modified version of the original intervention. It is not clear how and when treatment protocols are used or modified in the Dutch specialized mental health care and whether these changes lead to suboptimal adherence to treatment protocols. In the context of an ongoing multicenter trial that investigates whether twice-weekly sessions of protocolized interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression lead to better treatment outcomes compared to once-weekly sessions, two focus groups using semi-structured interviews were organized. Aims were to increase insight in the adherence to and modifications of CBT and IPT protocols in the Dutch specialized mental health care for depression. Participants were fifteen therapists from seven mental health locations part of five mental health organizations. Verbatim transcripts were coded and analyzed using qualitative software. Three themes emerged: modification as the common practice, professional and patient factors influencing the adherence to protocols and organizational boundaries and flexibility. Treatment modification appeared to happen on a frequent basis, even in the context of a trial. Definitions of treatment modifications were multiple and varied from using intuition to flexible use of the same protocol. Therapist training and supervision, the years of work experience and individual characteristics of the therapist and the patient were mentioned to influence the adherence to protocols.

29955151,Pretreatment and early-treatment cortical thickness is associated with SSRI treatment response in major depressive disorder.,"To date, there are no biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment response in clinical use. Such biomarkers could allow for individualized treatment selection, reducing time spent on ineffective treatments and the burden of MDD. In search of such a biomarker, multisite pretreatment and early-treatment (1 week into treatment) structural magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired from 184 patients with MDD randomized to an 8-week trial of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline or placebo. This study represents a large, multisite, placebo-controlled effort to examine the association between pretreatment differences or early-treatment changes in cortical thickness and treatment-specific outcomes. For standardization, a novel, robust site harmonization procedure was applied to structural measures in a priori regions (rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, lateral orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and hippocampus), chosen based on previously published reports. Pretreatment cortical thickness or volume did not significantly associate with SSRI response. Thickening of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the first week of treatment was associated with better 8-week responses to SSRI (p = 0.010).

GABA-A receptor agonist (GABAA-RA) treatment is often used, but long-term use is controversial due to the poor risk-benefit ratio resulting from drug dependence and potential cognitive impairment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of add-on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and GABAA-RA dose-tapering in patients with primary insomnia resistant to pharmacotherapy. This randomized, multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group study compared CBT-I and treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with persistent primary insomnia despite GABAA-RA treatment.

Post-treatment outcomes of this study were previously published and details of its design can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT02237300). This article focuses on the evolution of symptoms assessed after 6 months of followup in a subgroup of 58 patients from the original study. In this study 64 patients with eating disorders (EDs) (35 with BN and 29 with BED), who still showed active episodes of binge eating by the end of a structured CBT program (first-level treatment), were randomly assigned to one of two second-level treatments (A-CBT or VR-CET). Frequency of binge and purge episodes, and attitudinal features of binge-related EDs (bulimia, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction) were assessed before starting the second-level treatment (n = 64), at the end (n = 64), and at 6-month followup (n = 58). Mixed between-within subject analyses of variance were used to compare outcomes of both second-level treatments over time. Although both treatment conditions showed statistically significant improvements at the end and after 6-month followup, obtained reductions were greater after VR-CET, regarding binge and purge episodes, as well as the decrease of self-reported tendency to engage in overeating episodes. Accordingly, abstinence from binge episodes were higher in VR-CET than A-CBT at followup (70 percent vs. 26 percent, respectively; χ = 11.711, p = 0.001).

To evaluate whether an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention is at least as effective as established individualized face-to-face clinical care in reducing tinnitus distress and tinnitus-related difficulties. A randomized, multicenter, 2-arm parallel group, noninferiority trial with 2-month follow-up was performed between October 4, 2016, and July 14, 2017. Invited to participate were 374 adults based in the United Kingdom who had been referred to their local tinnitus clinics because of bothersome tinnitus. The experimental group received the internet-based intervention online, and the active control group underwent the usual face-to-face tinnitus care at 1 of 3 UK-based National Health Service hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either intervention using variable permuted block sizes of 4 and 6.

30348514,"Pharmacokinetics and Short-term Safety of ALKS 3831, a Fixed-dose Combination of Olanzapine and Samidorphan, in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia.","ALKS 3831 is composed of a flexible dose of olanzapine and a fixed dose of 10-mg samidorphan (a novel opioid system modulator), designed to provide the established antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine and to mitigate olanzapine-induced weight gain. To support clinical development of ALKS 3831, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase I study to obtain steady-state exposure for olanzapine and samidorphan and short-term safety at the intended therapeutic dose range of ALKS 3831 10/10 (10-mg olanzapine/10-mg samidorphan) to ALKS 3831 20/10 (20-mg olanzapine/10-mg samidorphan) in subjects with schizophrenia. After a 1-week olanzapine lead-in period, 42 subjects (14 women) with schizophrenia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ALKS 3831 10/10 or ALKS 3831 20/10 bilayer oral tablets once daily for 14 days. Plasma concentrations of olanzapine and samidorphan were quantified by using an LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to noncompartmental analysis. Safety was monitored throughout the study. After a 1-week olanzapine lead-in phase with titration of olanzapine dose up to 15 mg/d, the steady-state concentration of olanzapine was reached in 3-4 days and that of samidorphan was reached in 5 days after initiation of once-daily oral administration of ALKS 3831 10/10 or ALKS 3831 20/10. At steady state, exposure to olanzapine increased dose proportionally from 10 mg (ALKS 3831 10/10) to 20 mg (ALKS 3831 20/10), and exposure to samidorphan was similar between the 2 ALKS 3831 dose groups, indicating that different dose levels of olanzapine in ALKS 3831 had no impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of samidorphan. ALKS 3831 was well tolerated, and no safety concerns unique to ALKS 3831 compared with olanzapine monotherapy were identified.

To support clinical development of ALKS 3831, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase I study to obtain steady-state exposure for olanzapine and samidorphan and short-term safety at the intended therapeutic dose range of ALKS 3831 10/10 (10-mg olanzapine/10-mg samidorphan) to ALKS 3831 20/10 (20-mg olanzapine/10-mg samidorphan) in subjects with schizophrenia. After a 1-week olanzapine lead-in period, 42 subjects (14 women) with schizophrenia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ALKS 3831 10/10 or ALKS 3831 20/10 bilayer oral tablets once daily for 14 days. Plasma concentrations of olanzapine and samidorphan were quantified by using an LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to noncompartmental analysis. Safety was monitored throughout the study. After a 1-week olanzapine lead-in phase with titration of olanzapine dose up to 15 mg/d, the steady-state concentration of olanzapine was reached in 3-4 days and that of samidorphan was reached in 5 days after initiation of once-daily oral administration of ALKS 3831 10/10 or ALKS 3831 20/10. At steady state, exposure to olanzapine increased dose proportionally from 10 mg (ALKS 3831 10/10) to 20 mg (ALKS 3831 20/10), and exposure to samidorphan was similar between the 2 ALKS 3831 dose groups, indicating that different dose levels of olanzapine in ALKS 3831 had no impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of samidorphan. ALKS 3831 was well tolerated, and no safety concerns unique to ALKS 3831 compared with olanzapine monotherapy were identified. In the present study, samidorphan exposure was not affected by different dose levels of olanzapine in ALKS 3831.

30407932,Simple Electroencephalographic Treatment-Emergent Marker Can Predict Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Antidepressant Response-A Feasibility Study.,"Prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) repeated daily for 4 to 6 weeks is used to treat major depressive disorder, but more than 50% of patients do not achieve significant response. Here we test the validity of a simple electroencephalographic (EEG) marker that predicts nonresponse to rTMS. Such a marker could potentially increase rTMS effectiveness by directing nonresponders to alternative treatments or by guiding early modification of stimulation parameters. We retrospectively analyzed 2-channel EEG data captured in the OPT-TMS National Institute of Mental Health-sponsored, multicenter study. Cumulative Brain Engagement Index (cBEI), a measure derived from template matching that allows scoring EEG dynamics along treatment, was computed. Six hundred sixty-five EEG recordings were analyzed. In the rTMS group, the median cBEI was found to increase in the responder group but remained unchanged in the nonresponder group. The difference between the cBEI of the groups became statistically significant by the third valid EEG sample. Within 5 samples, 91% of the responders presented with a cBEI above a preset threshold. Within 9 samples, 17% of the nonresponders had a cBEI above the threshold. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a simple-to-capture EEG marker as a treatment-emergent marker of response to rTMS treatment of depression. In the OPT-TMS study, discontinuing treatment when the cBEI dropped below the threshold between the fifth to ninth treatment potentially could have avoided administration of 485 (63%) of 765 treatments.

Participants in the multi-site Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study ( n=278) provided data to evaluate the factor structure and sensitivity to change over time of the CHRT-SR through eight weeks of a clinical trial in which participants received either placebo or antidepressant medication (sertraline). Factor analysis confirmed two factors: propensity (comprised of first-order factors including pessimism, helplessness, social support, and despair) and suicidal thoughts.

30661552,Early Change Trajectories in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Binge-Eating Disorder.,"Rapid response is considered the most well-established outcome predictor across treatments of binge-eating disorder (BED), including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). This study sought to identify latent trajectories of early change in CBT and compare them to common rapid response classifications. In a multicenter randomized trial, 86 adults with BED (DSM-IV) or subsyndromal BED provided weekly self-reports of binge eating over the first 4 weeks of CBT, which were analyzed to predict binge eating, depression, and body mass index at posttreatment, 6-, and 18-month follow-up. Using latent growth mixture modeling, three patterns of early change-including moderate and low decreasing-as well as low stable binge eating were identified, which significantly predicted binge-eating remission at 6-month follow-up. Other classifications of rapid response based on Receiver Operating Characteristics curve analyses or on the literature (≥ 10% reduction in binge eating at week 1, ≥ 70% reduction in binge eating at week 4) only predicted posttreatment remission or overall depression, respectively. Latent change trajectories, but not other rapid response classifications, predicted binge-eating frequency over time. A fine-grained analysis of change over the first 4 weeks of CBT for BED revealed different trajectories of early change in binge eating that led to an improved prediction of binge-eating outcome, compared to that of common rapid response classifications.

30916714,Efficacy and Tolerability of Adjunctive Intravenous Sodium Nitroprusside Treatment for Outpatients With Schizophrenia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Antipsychotic medications for the treatment of schizophrenia have limitations, and new treatments are needed. A prior pilot investigation suggested that adjunctive sodium nitroprusside (SNP) administered intravenously had rapid efficacy in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. To determine the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous SNP infused at a rate of 0.5 μg/kg/min for 4 hours in patients with schizophrenia with some degree of treatment resistance. Multicenter, randomized, double-blind acute treatment study using a sequential parallel comparison design conducted in two 2-week phases at 4 academic medical centers beginning May 20, 2015, and ending March 31, 2017. Participants were adults 18 to 65 years of age with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, taking antipsychotic medication for at least 8 weeks, and had at least 1 failed trial of an antipsychotic medication within the past year.

To evaluate sexual functioning in healthy volunteers administered vortioxetine compared with paroxetine, an antidepressant known to cause sexual dysfunction, and placebo. This phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, fixed-dose, head-to-head study compared sexual functioning in healthy volunteers administered vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg once daily [QD]), paroxetine (20 mg QD), or placebo for 5 weeks. Approximately equal numbers of men and women ages 18-40 years with normal sexual functioning (self-reported Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short-Form [CSFQ-14] score > 47 for men; > 41 for women) were enrolled. Two modified full analysis sets adjusting for treatment non-compliance were prespecified. The primary endpoint was change in CSFQ-14 total score for vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg) vs paroxetine after 5 weeks. Additional endpoints included CSFQ-14 change scores vs placebo, CSFQ-14 subscales, and patient global impression. Of the 361 subjects enrolled (mean age, 28.4 years), approximately 57% were white, 34% black/African American, and 4% Asian. Vortioxetine 10 mg was associated with significantly less TESD than paroxetine (mean difference, +2.74 points; P = .009). Although vortioxetine 20 mg was associated with numerically less TESD than paroxetine (mean difference, +1.05 points), this difference did not reach statistical significance. Non-compliance appeared to influence results, particularly the paroxetine and vortioxetine 20 mg arms. Paroxetine, but not vortioxetine, was associated with statistically significantly more TESD vs placebo. Vortioxetine also had better outcomes than paroxetine in the 3 phases and 5 dimensions of sexual functioning measured by CSFQ-14. These data establish that vortioxetine is associated with less TESD than paroxetine in healthy individuals, suggesting that vortioxetine may be a drug of choice in managing depressive disorders when sexual functioning is a concern. Conducting the study in healthy adults mitigated the risk of an underlying condition (eg, depression) confounding the results. Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by statistically significant TESD with paroxetine vs placebo. The single comparator, paroxetine, and short study duration limit the generalizability of these results. Vortioxetine is associated with less TESD than paroxetine in healthy adults across all phases and dimensions of the sexual response cycle.

To evaluate sexual functioning in healthy volunteers administered vortioxetine compared with paroxetine, an antidepressant known to cause sexual dysfunction, and placebo. This phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, fixed-dose, head-to-head study compared sexual functioning in healthy volunteers administered vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg once daily [QD]), paroxetine (20 mg QD), or placebo for 5 weeks. Approximately equal numbers of men and women ages 18-40 years with normal sexual functioning (self-reported Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short-Form [CSFQ-14] score > 47 for men; > 41 for women) were enrolled. Two modified full analysis sets adjusting for treatment non-compliance were prespecified. The primary endpoint was change in CSFQ-14 total score for vortioxetine (10 and 20 mg) vs paroxetine after 5 weeks. Additional endpoints included CSFQ-14 change scores vs placebo, CSFQ-14 subscales, and patient global impression. Of the 361 subjects enrolled (mean age, 28.4 years), approximately 57% were white, 34% black/African American, and 4% Asian. Vortioxetine 10 mg was associated with significantly less TESD than paroxetine (mean difference, +2.74 points; P = .009). Although vortioxetine 20 mg was associated with numerically less TESD than paroxetine (mean difference, +1.05 points), this difference did not reach statistical significance. Non-compliance appeared to influence results, particularly the paroxetine and vortioxetine 20 mg arms. Paroxetine, but not vortioxetine, was associated with statistically significantly more TESD vs placebo. Vortioxetine also had better outcomes than paroxetine in the 3 phases and 5 dimensions of sexual functioning measured by CSFQ-14. These data establish that vortioxetine is associated with less TESD than paroxetine in healthy individuals, suggesting that vortioxetine may be a drug of choice in managing depressive disorders when sexual functioning is a concern. Conducting the study in healthy adults mitigated the risk of an underlying condition (eg, depression) confounding the results. Assay sensitivity was demonstrated by statistically significant TESD with paroxetine vs placebo. The single comparator, paroxetine, and short study duration limit the generalizability of these results. Vortioxetine is associated with less TESD than paroxetine in healthy adults across all phases and dimensions of the sexual response cycle. Vortioxetine was not significantly different from placebo on sexual functioning; however, the difference was significant between paroxetine and placebo, validating study results.

31437703,Normalization of EEG in depression after antidepressant treatment with sertraline? A preliminary report.,"MDD patients with abnormal EEG patterns seem more likely to be non-responsive to the antidepressants escitalopram and venlafaxine, but not sertraline, than patients without EEG abnormalities. This finding suggests that patients with both MDD and abnormal EEGs may differentially respond to antidepressant treatment. In the current study, we investigated whether depressed patients with an abnormal EEG show a normalization of the EEG related to antidepressant treatment and response and whether such effect is drug specific, and whether having had early life stress (ELS) increases the chance of abnormal activity. Baseline and week 8 EEGs and depression symptoms were extracted from a large multicenter study (iSPOT-D, n = 1008) where depressed patients were randomized to escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR treatment.

31688449,Dopamine D2 Receptor Occupancy Estimated From Plasma Concentrations of Four Different Antipsychotics and the Subjective Experience of Physical and Mental Well-Being in Schizophrenia: Results From the Randomized NeSSy Trial.,"Impaired subjective well-being in schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotics has often been linked inter alia to the antidopaminergic effects of medication. Thus, it is important to capture the association between striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (D2-RO) and global subjective well-being. We examined this association using data from our multicenter, randomized, double-blind Neuroleptic Strategy Study (NeSSy). An innovative double randomization process was used for allocation of patients to the specific treatment groups. Plasma drug concentrations were measured after 6 and 24 weeks of treatment to obtain the estimated D2-RO (eD2-RO) relative to literature values. We made an exploratory analysis of associations between eD2-RO and subjective well-being scores. One hundred two blood samples from 69 patients were available for the analysis. Because of the lack of a satisfactory occupancy model for quetiapine, only haloperidol, flupentixol, and olanzapine treatment groups were pooled, whereas aripiprazole data were analyzed separately, because of its partial agonistic properties. In the pooled antagonist group, eD2-RO correlated negatively with the summarized well-being score. In a more detailed analysis, this association could be confirmed for all first-generation antipsychotic-treated patients, but not for the separate second-generation antipsychotic groups. In the aripiprazole group, higher eD2-RO was associated with impaired physical well-being, but had no association with mental well-being. Our results suggest that high plasma levels and consequently high occupancy at D2 receptors are disadvantageous for subjective well-being, as distinct from the objective extrapyramidal side effects. To minimize patients' malaise, which disfavors adherence, implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring in the clinical routine may be useful.",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,2019,10.1097/JCP.0000000000001131,success,2010,2019,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,Dopamine D2 Receptor Occupancy Estimated From Plasma Concentrations of Four Different Antipsychotics and the Subjective Experience of Physical and Mental Well-Being in Schizophrenia: Results From the Randomized NeSSy Trial.,"Impaired subjective well-being in schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotics has often been linked inter alia to the antidopaminergic effects of medication.

In a more detailed analysis, this association could be confirmed for all first-generation antipsychotic-treated patients, but not for the separate second-generation antipsychotic groups. In the aripiprazole group, higher eD2-RO was associated with impaired physical well-being, but had no association with mental well-being. Our results suggest that high plasma levels and consequently high occupancy at D2 receptors are disadvantageous for subjective well-being, as distinct from the objective extrapyramidal side effects. To minimize patients' malaise, which disfavors adherence, implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring in the clinical routine may be useful.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

Improved therapeutics have long been a goal of research. Preclinical testing suggests that phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors may provide a novel approach to treating psychosis associated with schizophrenia. The efficacy and safety of a highly selective PDE10A inhibitor, PF-02545920, was evaluated in a phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Eligible patients (18-65 years) with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were randomized 2:2:1:2 to PF-02545920 (5 or 15 mg every 12 hours [Q12H] titrated), risperidone (3 mg Q12H), or placebo for 28 days (n = 74:74:37:74). The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of PF-02545920 using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS) and safety/tolerability. At day 28, PF-02545920 (either dose) was not significantly different from placebo for mean change from baseline in the PANNS total score (primary end point) or most other end points. Pharmacokinetics exposures seemed adequate for binding/inhibiting PDE10A enzyme. Risperidone was statistically different from placebo for the PANNS total score, demonstrating study sensitivity.

Concerning animal and uncontrolled human data suggest antipsychotics are associated with change in brain structure, but to our knowledge, there are no controlled human studies that have yet addressed this question. To assess the effects of antipsychotics on brain structure in humans. Prespecified secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial over a 36-week period at 5 academic centers. All participants, aged 18 to 85 years, were recruited from the multicenter Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression II (STOP-PD II). All participants had major depressive disorder with psychotic features (psychotic depression) and were prescribed olanzapine and sertraline for a period of 12 to 20 weeks, which included 8 weeks of remission of psychosis and remission/near remission of depression. Participants were then were randomized to continue receiving this regimen or to be switched to placebo and sertraline for a subsequent 36-week period. Data were analyzed between October 2018 and February 2019. Those who consented to the imaging study completed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at the time of randomization and a second MRI scan at the end of the 36-week period or at time of relapse. The primary outcome measure was cortical thickness in gray matter and the secondary outcome measure was microstructural integrity of white matter. Eighty-eight participants (age range, 18-85 years) completed a baseline scan; 75 completed a follow-up scan, of which 72 (32 men and 40 women) were useable for final analyses. There was a significant treatment-group by time interaction in cortical thickness (left, t = 3.3; P = .001; right, t = 3.6; P < .001) but not surface area. No significant interaction was found for fractional anisotropy, but one for mean diffusivity of the white matter skeleton was present (t = -2.6, P = .01). When the analysis was restricted to those who sustained remission, exposure to olanzapine compared with placebo was associated with significant decreases in cortical thickness in the left hemisphere (β [SE], 0.04 [0.009]; t34.4 = 4.7; P <.001), and the right hemisphere (β [SE], 0.03 [0.009]; t35.1 = 3.6; P <.001).

Very little research has focused on alternative methods of treatment for depression using CBT. Thus, there is a need for research into other therapeutic approaches. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of 3 low-intensity, internet-based psychological interventions (healthy lifestyle psychoeducational program [HLP], focused program on positive affect promotion [PAPP], and brief intervention based on mindfulness [MP]) compared with a control condition (improved treatment as usual [iTAU]). A multicenter, 4-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted between March 2015 and March 2016, with a follow-up of 12 months.

Patients were randomly distributed to iTAU (n=57), HLP (n=54), PAPP (n=56), and MP (n=54). All patients received iTAU from their general practitioners. The main outcome was the Spanish version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from pretreatment (time 1) to posttreatment (time 2) and up to 6 (time 3) and 12 (time 4) months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale of the EuroQol, the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI).

A moderate decrease was detected in PHQ-9 scores from HLP (β=-3.05; P=.01) and MP (β=-3.00; P=.01) compared with iTAU at posttreatment. There were significant differences between all intervention groups and iTAU in physical SF-12 scores at 6 months after treatment.

32518042,Population Pharmacokinetics Analysis of Quetiapine Extended-release Formulation in Japanese Patients with Bipolar Depression.,"The objectives of this study were to explore covariates of plasma quetiapine concentrations after oral administration of quetiapine extended-release formulation (XR), and to examine the exposure-response relationship in Japanese patients with bipolar depression, using population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) modeling. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine XR in patients with bipolar depression, plasma for the measurement of quetiapine concentration was collected at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 52 during oral administration of 150 or 300 mg once daily of quetiapine XR before bedtime. A PopPK model of quetiapine XR was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling with first-order conditional estimation with interactions. The exposure-response relationship was examined using post-hoc exposures. The post-hoc AUC estimate was plotted against the change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (ΔMADRS) total score from baseline to 8 weeks following once-daily doses at 300 mg. The final PopPK analysis dataset contained 322 patients and 1162 observations (cutoff data at week 28; cutoff date, February 2016). The plasma quetiapine concentration-time profile in patients with bipolar depression after oral administration of quetiapine XR was represented well using a 1-compartment with first-order absorption model. Covariate analysis led to the selection of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase on apparent oral clearance and body weight on apparent volume of distribution as covariates. The final population mean values of apparent oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 87.7 L/h and 277 L, respectively, and the interindividual %CVs were 32.6% and 75.0%, respectively. The effects of covariates on PK parameters were not large compared with the interindividual variability. In addition, there was no clear relationship between the AUC and ΔMADRS.

Approved AL doses and dosing regimens include 441 mg monthly, 662 mg monthly, and 882 mg monthly or every 6 weeks (q6wk), as well as the most recently approved dose, 1064 mg, administered every 2 months. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of an AL regimen with a dose interval of every 2 months (1064 mg) were compared with two other regimens available as monthly and q6wk options. This study evaluated pharmacokinetics of AL given at a higher dosage strength (1064 mg) and at a longer dose interval (every 8 weeks [q8wk]) than previously studied. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder entering this 44-week, phase I, open-label, multicenter study had no recent exposure to aripiprazole and were maintained on other oral antipsychotics throughout the study. Patients were randomized to one of three AL dose regimens for 24 weeks (four 1064-mg injections [q8wk], five 882-mg injections [q6wk], or seven 441-mg injections [q4wk], with the last AL exposure at week 24). Oral aripiprazole was prohibited. Patients were followed for an additional 20 weeks to assess terminal aripiprazole plasma concentrations and ongoing safety. Plasma concentration samples were obtained at regular intervals to provide pharmacokinetic data for the duration of AL exposure and to measure persistence of plasma aripiprazole concentrations after AL discontinuation. Eligible patients received AL 1064 mg q8wk (n = 35), 882 mg q6wk (n = 34), or 441 mg q4wk (n = 35). Overall, 103/104 (99.0%) patients were taking concomitant non-aripiprazole oral antipsychotic medications during the study. All three AL dose regimens provided continuous exposure to aripiprazole. Mean aripiprazole concentrations from the 1064-mg q8wk regimen were comparable to the 882-mg q6wk regimen and higher than the 441-mg q4wk regimen.

Parents (N = 73) participated in a parallel multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing an intervention group to a waitlist control group. In the group intervention Op Koers Online (English: On Track Online) parents learned how to use adaptive coping strategies taught with cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy techniques. Assessments (online questionnaires) took place at baseline (T0), 6-months (T1), and 12-months (T2) follow-up. Mixed-model analyses were performed to test the difference in change in outcomes between intervention (N = 34) and waitlist control group (N = 33). When compared with the waitlist control group, the intervention had a significant positive effect (p < .05) on changes in anxiety, depression, and total score T1 versus T0 (β = -.47 to -.51) and T2 versus T0 (β = -.39 to -.46), the coping skills open communication, relaxation, social support, acceptance, predictive control (β = .42-.88) and helplessness (β = -.47) T1 versus T0 and relaxation and positive thinking T2 versus T0 (β = .42-.53).

3323261,The risks and benefits of clozapine versus chlorpromazine.,"Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with reduced risk of unwanted neurological effects in comparison with other drugs. In this multicenter study, 151 hospitalized schizophrenic patients were randomly assigned to treatment under double-blind conditions to assess the antipsychotic efficacy and safety of clozapine versus chlorpromazine. All patients exhibited tardive dyskinesia or other extrapyramidal side effects associated with at least two prior neuroleptics. Eleven patients were dropped from treatment due to extrapyramidal symptoms while being treated with chlorpromazine; only one clozapine patient's treatment was terminated for this reason. Clozapine patients exhibited clinical improvement superior to that of chlorpromazine patients as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating and Clinical Global Impression scales. These results suggest that clozapine is well tolerated and may be therapeutically superior to chlorpromazine in treating psychotic behavior. Agranulocytosis potential can be minimized by frequent white blood cell counts and removing nonresponding patients from treatment prior to the peak risk period (months 2 through 6).",Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,1987,,noncompliant,1980,1987,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,The risks and benefits of clozapine versus chlorpromazine.,"Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with reduced risk of unwanted neurological effects in comparison with other drugs.

33355633,Effectiveness of Transdiagnostic Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy Compared With Management as Usual for Youth With Common Mental Health Problems: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Behavioral therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) programs targeting a single class of problems have not been widely implemented. The population of youths with common mental health problems is markedly undertreated. To determine the effectiveness of a new transdiagnostic CBT program (Mind My Mind [MMM]) compared with management as usual (MAU) in youths with emotional and behavioral problems below the threshold for referral to mental health care. This pragmatic, multisite, randomized clinical trial of MMM vs MAU was conducted from September 7, 2017, to August 28, 2019, including 8 weeks of postintervention follow-up, in 4 municipalities in Denmark. Consecutive help-seeking youths were randomized (1:1) to the MMM or the MAU group. Main inclusion criteria were age 6 to 16 years and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and/or behavioral disturbances as a primary problem. Data were analyzed from August 12 to October 25, 2019. The MMM intervention consisted of 9 to 13 weekly, individually adapted sessions of manualized CBT delivered by local psychologists. The MAU group received 2 care coordination visits to enhance usual care. The primary outcome was change in mental health problems reported by parents at week 18, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) Impact scale (range, 0-10 points, with higher scores indicating greater severity of distress and impairment). Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population at week 18. Maintenance effects were assessed at week 26. A total of 396 youths (mean [SD] age, 10.3 [2.4] years; 206 [52.0%] boys) were randomized to MMM (n = 197) or MAU (n = 199), with primary outcome data available in 177 (89.8%) and 167 (83.9%), respectively, at 18 weeks. The SDQ Impact score decreased by 2.34 points with MMM and 1.23 with MAU, from initial scores of 4.12 and 4.21, respectively (between-group difference, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.75-1.45]; P < .001; Cohen d = 0.60).

A total of 250 students (18-30 years of age, 66% female, 6.8% Latino, 66.3% Caucasian) with rigorously defined ADHD and comorbidity status were recruited from two public universities and randomly assigned to receive ACCESS immediately or on a 1-year delayed basis. Treatment response was assessed on three occasions, addressing primary (i.e., ADHD, executive functioning, depression, anxiety) and secondary (i.e., clinical change mechanisms, service utilization) outcomes. Latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) revealed significantly greater improvements among immediate ACCESS participants in terms of ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, clinical change mechanisms, and use of disability accommodations, representing medium to large effects (Cohen's d, .39-1.21). Across these same outcomes, clinical significance analyses using reliable change indices (RCI; Jacobson & Truax, 1992) revealed significantly higher percentages of ACCESS participants showing improvement. Although treatment-induced improvements in depression and anxiety were not evident from LGCM, RCI analyses indicated that immediate ACCESS participants were less likely to report a worsening in depression/anxiety symptoms.

33637231,Towards a unification of treatments and interventions for tinnitus patients: The EU research and innovation action UNITI.,"Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound and the patient's reaction to it. Although much progress has been made, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical enigma of high prevalence and high economic burden, with an estimated prevalence of 10%-20% among the adult population. The EU is funding a new collaborative project entitled ""Unification of Treatments and Interventions for Tinnitus Patients"" (UNITI, grant no. 848261) under its Horizon 2020 framework. The main goal of the UNITI project is to set the ground for a predictive computational model based on existing and longitudinal data attempting to address the question of which treatment or combination of treatments is optimal for a specific patient group based on certain parameters. Clinical, epidemiological, genetic and audiological data, including signals reflecting ear-brain communication, as well as patients' medical history, will be analyzed making use of existing databases. Predictive factors for different patient groups will be extracted and their prognostic relevance validated through a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) in which different patient groups will undergo a combination of tinnitus therapies targeting both auditory and central nervous systems. From a scientific point of view, the UNITI project can be summarized into the following research goals: (1) Analysis of existing data: Results of existing clinical studies will be analyzed to identify subgroups of patients with specific treatment responses and to identify systematic differences between the patient groups at the participating clinical centers. (2) Genetic and blood biomarker analysis: High throughput Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) will be performed in well-characterized chronic tinnitus cases, together with Proximity Extension Assays (PEA) for the identification of blood biomarkers for tinnitus. (3) RCT: A total of 500 patients will be recruited at five clinical centers across Europe comparing single treatments against combinational treatments. The four main treatments are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), hearing aids, sound stimulation, and structured counseling. The consortium will also make use of e/m-health applications for the treatment and assessment of tinnitus.

Aripiprazole has been reported to preserve hippocampal volume and to reduce inflammation. Study 1 was a 12-month multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of citalopram added to clinician-determined second-generation antipsychotic medication in 95 patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES), 19 of whom received aripiprazole. We compared participants taking aripiprazole with those on other antipsychotics to determine whether those on aripiprazole had less hippocampal volume loss. We also examined peripheral biomarker data from medication-naive patients with schizophrenia receiving 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment (n = 24) to see whether markers of inflammation and oxidative stress that previously predicted hippocampal volume differed between aripiprazole (n = 9) and other antipsychotics (study 2). Aripiprazole was associated with a mean increase in hippocampal volume of 0.35% (SD, 0.80%) compared with a 0.53% decrease (SD, 1.2%) with other antipsychotics during the first year of maintenance treatment in patients with FES. This difference was significant after adjusting for age, sex, citalopram treatment, and baseline Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score (B = 0.0079, P = 0.03). Aripiprazole was also associated with reduced concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor (P < 0.01) during the first 8 weeks of treatment in medication-naive patients with FES.

34446114,Bouldering psychotherapy is effective in enhancing perceived self-efficacy in people with depression: results from a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Recent studies have suggested that therapeutic climbing/bouldering may have positive effects on perceived self-efficacy. Nevertheless, there is still an urgent need for high-quality studies, as many existing studies have suffered from methodological problems. Therefore, the current work was aimed at investigating the effect of a manualized bouldering psychotherapy (BPT) on perceived self-efficacy in people with depression, compared with a home-based physical exercise program (EP) and state-of-the-art cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT). In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 233 people with depression were randomly assigned to one group (BPT, EP, or CBT). Perceived self-efficacy was assessed at baseline (t0) and directly after the 10-week intervention period (t1) with the GSE. In addition, depression was assessed with the PHQ-9 and the MADRS. We computed t tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), confounder-adjusted hierarchical regression analyses, mediation analyses, and several sensitivity analyses. BPT participants showed a significantly larger increase in perceived self-efficacy on the GSE compared with the EP (an increase of 3.04 vs. 1.26 points, p = .016, Cohen's d = 0.39). In the confounder-adjusted hierarchical multiple regression analysis, group allocation (BPT vs. EP) was found to be the only significant predictor of the postintervention GSE score (β = .16, p = .014) besides the baseline GSE score (β = .69, p < .001). No differences were found between BPT and CBT participants regarding the effect on perceived self-efficacy. Only in the CBT group, the relationship between depression at baseline and postintervention was partially mediated (23%) by perceived self-efficacy.

Nevertheless, there is still an urgent need for high-quality studies, as many existing studies have suffered from methodological problems. Therefore, the current work was aimed at investigating the effect of a manualized bouldering psychotherapy (BPT) on perceived self-efficacy in people with depression, compared with a home-based physical exercise program (EP) and state-of-the-art cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBT). In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 233 people with depression were randomly assigned to one group (BPT, EP, or CBT). Perceived self-efficacy was assessed at baseline (t0) and directly after the 10-week intervention period (t1) with the GSE. In addition, depression was assessed with the PHQ-9 and the MADRS. We computed t tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), confounder-adjusted hierarchical regression analyses, mediation analyses, and several sensitivity analyses. BPT participants showed a significantly larger increase in perceived self-efficacy on the GSE compared with the EP (an increase of 3.04 vs. 1.26 points, p = .016, Cohen's d = 0.39). In the confounder-adjusted hierarchical multiple regression analysis, group allocation (BPT vs. EP) was found to be the only significant predictor of the postintervention GSE score (β = .16, p = .014) besides the baseline GSE score (β = .69, p < .001). No differences were found between BPT and CBT participants regarding the effect on perceived self-efficacy.

The ANTidepressants to prevent reLapse in dEpRession (ANTLER) trial investigated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antidepressant medication in preventing relapse in UK primary care. This was a Phase IV, double-blind, pragmatic, multisite, individually randomised parallel-group controlled trial, with follow-up at 6, 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. Participants were randomised using minimisation on centre, type of antidepressant and baseline depressive symptom score above or below the median using Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised (two categories). Statisticians were blind to allocation for the outcome analyses. General practices in London, Bristol, Southampton and York. Individuals aged 18-74 years who had experienced at least two episodes of depression and had been taking antidepressants for ≥ 9 months but felt well enough to consider stopping their medication. Those who met an , Tenth Revision, diagnosis of depression or with other psychiatric conditions were excluded. At baseline, participants were taking citalopram 20 mg, sertraline 100 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg or mirtazapine 30 mg. They were randomised to either remain on their current medication or discontinue medication after a tapering period. The primary outcome was the time, in weeks, to the beginning of the first depressive episode after randomisation. This was measured by a retrospective Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised that assessed the onset of a depressive episode in the previous 12 weeks, and was conducted at 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. The depression-related resource use was collected over 12 months from medical records and patient-completed questionnaires. Quality-adjusted life-years were calculated using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version. Between 9 March 2017 and 1 March 2019, we randomised 238 participants to antidepressant continuation (the maintenance group) and 240 participants to antidepressant discontinuation (the discontinuation group). The time to relapse of depression was shorter in the discontinuation group, with a hazard ratio of 2.06 (95% confidence interval 1.56 to 2.70;  < 0.0001). By 52 weeks, relapse was experienced by 39% of those who continued antidepressants and 56% of those who discontinued antidepressants. The secondary analysis revealed that people who discontinued experienced more withdrawal symptoms than those who remained on medication, with the largest difference at 12 weeks. In the discontinuation group, 37% (95% confidence interval 28% to 45%) of participants remained on their randomised medication until the end of the trial. In total, 39% (95% confidence interval 32% to 45%) of participants in the discontinuation group returned to their original antidepressant compared with 20% (95% confidence interval 15% to 25%) of participants in maintenance group. The health economic evaluation demonstrated that participants randomised to discontinuation had worse utility scores at 3 months (-0.037, 95% confidence interval -0.059 to -0.015) and fewer quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months (-0.019, 95% confidence interval -0.035 to -0.003) than those randomised to continuation. The discontinuation pathway, besides giving worse outcomes, also cost more [extra £2.71 per patient over 12 months (95% confidence interval -£36.10 to £37.07)] than the continuation pathway, although the cost difference was not significant. Patients who discontinue long-term maintenance antidepressants in primary care are at increased risk of relapse and withdrawal symptoms. However, a substantial proportion of patients can discontinue antidepressants without relapse. Our findings will give patients and clinicians an estimate of the likely benefits and harms of stopping long-term maintenance antidepressants and improve shared decision-making. The participants may not have been representative of all people on long-term maintenance treatment and we could study only a restricted range of antidepressants and doses.

34951503,Group autonomy enhancing treatment versus cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: A cluster-randomized clinical trial.,"Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, few evidence-based alternatives exist. Autonomy enhancing treatment (AET) aims to decrease the vulnerability for anxiety disorders by targeting underlying autonomy deficits and may therefore have similar effects on anxiety as CBT, but yield broader effects. A multicenter cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted including 129 patients with DSM-5 anxiety disorders, on average 33.66 years of age (SD = 12.57), 91 (70.5%) female, and most (92.2%) born in the Netherlands.

However, previous studies on prevention of gaming disorder and unspecified internet use disorder lacked randomization, follow-up measurements, and diagnostic interviews that assessed incidence rates; this trial was intended to fill this gap. To investigate whether the PROTECT (Professioneller Umgang mit technischen Medien [Professional Use of Technical Media]) intervention can reduce the symptom severity and prevent full syndrome and subthreshold onset of gaming disorder and unspecified internet use disorder in at-risk adolescents. A multicenter cluster randomized clinical trial conducted recruitment, screening, intervention delivery, and data collection among at-risk adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in 33 high schools in Germany. Inclusion criteria for the study and symptom severity analyses were elevated symptoms of gaming disorder and unspecified internet use disorder. A subsample that met the inclusion criteria for incidence analyses (no full syndrome of gaming disorder or unspecified internet use disorder, depression, or anxiety at baseline) was analyzed for illness onset.

35311687,Effect of Sleep Disturbance Symptoms on Treatment Outcome in Blended Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression (E-COMPARED Study): Secondary Analysis.,"Sleep disturbance symptoms are common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and have been found to hamper the treatment effect of conventional face-to-face psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy. To increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment, blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) consisting of web-based and face-to-face treatment is on the rise for patients with MDD. To date, no study has examined whether sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on bCBT treatment outcomes and whether it affects bCBT and treatment-as-usual (TAU) equally. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether baseline sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on treatment outcomes independent of treatment modality and whether sleep disturbance symptoms impact bCBT and TAU in routine care equally. The study was based on data from the E-COMPARED (European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment Versus Treatment-as-Usual) study, a 2-arm, multisite, parallel randomized controlled, noninferiority trial. A total of 943 outpatients with MDD were randomized to either bCBT (476/943, 50.5%) or TAU consisting of routine clinical MDD treatment (467/943, 49.5%). The primary outcome of this study was the change in depression symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the change in depression symptom severity at the 3- and 6-month follow-up and MDD diagnoses at the 12-month follow-up, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. Mixed effects models were used to examine the association of sleep disturbance symptoms with treatment outcome and treatment modality over time. Of the 943 patients recruited for the study, 558 (59.2%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. In the total sample, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms did not significantly affect change in depressive symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up (β=.16, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.36).

To increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment, blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT) consisting of web-based and face-to-face treatment is on the rise for patients with MDD. To date, no study has examined whether sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on bCBT treatment outcomes and whether it affects bCBT and treatment-as-usual (TAU) equally. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether baseline sleep disturbance symptoms have an impact on treatment outcomes independent of treatment modality and whether sleep disturbance symptoms impact bCBT and TAU in routine care equally. The study was based on data from the E-COMPARED (European Comparative Effectiveness Research on Blended Depression Treatment Versus Treatment-as-Usual) study, a 2-arm, multisite, parallel randomized controlled, noninferiority trial. A total of 943 outpatients with MDD were randomized to either bCBT (476/943, 50.5%) or TAU consisting of routine clinical MDD treatment (467/943, 49.5%). The primary outcome of this study was the change in depression symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the change in depression symptom severity at the 3- and 6-month follow-up and MDD diagnoses at the 12-month follow-up, assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, respectively. Mixed effects models were used to examine the association of sleep disturbance symptoms with treatment outcome and treatment modality over time. Of the 943 patients recruited for the study, 558 (59.2%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. In the total sample, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms did not significantly affect change in depressive symptom severity at the 12-month follow-up (β=.16, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.36). However, baseline sleep disturbance symptoms were negatively associated with treatment outcome for bCBT (β=.49, 95% CI 0.22-0.76) but not for TAU (β=-.23, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.05) at the 12-month follow-up, even when adjusting for baseline depression symptom severity.

35551065,The Effects of a Web-Based Tool for Parents of Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of autoinflammatory diseases that cause pain and disability if not controlled by treatment. Parenting a child with JIA is stressful for parents, who express concerns about their child's treatment and may experience anxiety and powerlessness concerning their child's illness. Parenting stress is greater in parents of children with chronic illness than in those with healthy children and is related to poorer psychological adjustment in both parents and children. It is therefore important to develop interventions to support parents. This paper reports the evaluation of a web-based tool that provides information and practical skills to help increase parents' confidence in managing their child's illness and reduce parenting stress. The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits of a web-based tool (WebParC) for parents of children with recently diagnosed JIA. A multicentered randomized controlled trial was conducted at pediatric rheumatology centers in England. We recruited parents of children aged ≤12 years who had been diagnosed with JIA within the previous 6 months. They were randomized to the intervention (WebParC access plus standard care) or the control (standard care alone) and followed up 4 months and 12 months after randomization. Where both parents participated, they were randomized by household to the same trial arm. The WebParC intervention consists of information about JIA and its treatment plus a toolkit, based on cognitive behavioral therapy, to help parents develop skills to manage JIA-related issues. The primary outcome was the self-report Pediatric Inventory for Parents measure of illness-related parenting stress. The secondary outcomes were parental mood, self-efficacy, coping, effectiveness of participation in their child's health care, satisfaction with health care, and child's health-related quality of life. A total of 203 households comprising 220 parents were randomized to the intervention (100/203, 49.3%) or control (103/203, 50.7%) arm. Follow-up assessments were completed by 65.5% (133/203) of the households at 4 months (intervention 60/100, 60%, and control 73/103, 70.9%) and 61.1% (124/203) of the households at 12 months (intervention 58/100, 58%, and control 66/103, 64.1%). A main effect of the trial arm was found on the Pediatric Inventory for Parents: the intervention participants reported less frequency (subscales communication F=5.37; P=.02, and role function F=5.40; P=.02) and difficulty (subscales communication F=7.43; P=.006, medical care F=4.04; P=.04, and role function F=4.37, P=.04) regarding illness-related stressful events than the control participants.

36030033,Brief Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety and Depression in Pediatric Primary Care: Breadth of Intervention Impact.,"To report on broad-based outcomes of the Brief Behavioral Therapy (BBT) trial for pediatric anxiety and depression. Secondary data analyses expand on previous reports by assessing diagnostic remission and independent functioning, impact on targeted psychopathology, and spillover effects on non-targeted outcomes. Youth (N = 185; 8-16.9 years; 58% female; 78% White; 21% Hispanic) with anxiety and/or depression were eligible for this multi-site trial. Enrolled youth were randomly assigned to receive 8 to 12 sessions of BBT in primary care or assisted referral to outpatient care (ARC). Assessments were conducted 16 and 32 weeks post randomization. BBT was superior to ARC on remission of all targeted diagnoses (week 16: 56.8% vs 28.2%, p < .001; week 32: 62.5% vs 38.9%, p = .004), clinician-rated independent functioning (week 16: 75.0% vs 45.7%, p < .001; week 32: 81.2% vs 55.7%, p < .001), and on measures of anxiety, depression, suicide items, total comorbid behavioral and emotional problems, and hyperactivity (d = 0.21-0.49). Moderation analyses revealed superior outcomes for Hispanic youth in BBT vs ARC for diagnostic remission, anxiety, emotional problems, and parent-child conflict. Youth depression at baseline moderated effects on peer problems and parent-child conflict, with effects favoring BBT. Significant main and moderated effects of BBT on change in non-targeted outcomes were largely mediated by change in anxiety (24.2%-49.3% of total effects mediated).

Secondary data analyses expand on previous reports by assessing diagnostic remission and independent functioning, impact on targeted psychopathology, and spillover effects on non-targeted outcomes. Youth (N = 185; 8-16.9 years; 58% female; 78% White; 21% Hispanic) with anxiety and/or depression were eligible for this multi-site trial. Enrolled youth were randomly assigned to receive 8 to 12 sessions of BBT in primary care or assisted referral to outpatient care (ARC). Assessments were conducted 16 and 32 weeks post randomization. BBT was superior to ARC on remission of all targeted diagnoses (week 16: 56.8% vs 28.2%, p < .001; week 32: 62.5% vs 38.9%, p = .004), clinician-rated independent functioning (week 16: 75.0% vs 45.7%, p < .001; week 32: 81.2% vs 55.7%, p < .001), and on measures of anxiety, depression, suicide items, total comorbid behavioral and emotional problems, and hyperactivity (d = 0.21-0.49). Moderation analyses revealed superior outcomes for Hispanic youth in BBT vs ARC for diagnostic remission, anxiety, emotional problems, and parent-child conflict. Youth depression at baseline moderated effects on peer problems and parent-child conflict, with effects favoring BBT. Significant main and moderated effects of BBT on change in non-targeted outcomes were largely mediated by change in anxiety (24.2%-49.3% of total effects mediated). BBT has positive effects on youth, mediated by the strong impact of the intervention on anxiety.

36115638,A randomized controlled trial of emotion regulation therapy for cancer caregivers: A mechanism-targeted approach to addressing caregiver distress.,"Caregivers of patients with cancer play a crucial role in the health of the person they care for, and in the healthcare system at large. Family caregivers receive minimal support, despite being at greater risk for anxiety and depression than patients themselves. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an effective therapy for anxiety and depression, has shown mixed efficacy when delivered to cancer caregivers. Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT), a contemporary CBT, may uniquely target processes underlying distress associated with caregiving. Therefore, we adapted both CBT and ERT to target the needs of caregivers (i.e., CBT-C and ERT-C) and are conducting a multi-site randomized trial to examine the comparative efficacy of these interventions. Family cancer caregivers (n = 200) reporting distress related to caregiving are recruited from two academic cancer centers and randomly assigned to either ERT-C or CBT-C. Caregivers in both interventions engage in eight weekly one-hour sessions by videoconference with a trained interventionist. Caregiver participants complete study assessments at baseline, post-treatment, 3-and 6-months follow-up. Patients of each caregiver can also enroll in the study and complete assessments at baseline and 3-months follow-up. Outcome measures include psychosocial constructs such as anxiety, depression, quality of life, as well as proposed mechanistic constructs and salivary markers of stress and inflammation.

36179110,Longitudinal Network Analysis Reveals Interactive Change of Schizophrenia Symptoms During Acute Antipsychotic Treatment.,"Complex schizophrenia symptoms were recently conceptualized as interactive symptoms within a network system. However, it remains unknown how a schizophrenia network changed during acute antipsychotic treatment. The present study aimed to evaluate the interactive change of schizophrenia symptoms under seven antipsychotics from individual time series. Data on 3030 schizophrenia patients were taken from a multicenter randomized clinical trial and used to estimate the partial correlation cross-sectional networks and longitudinal random slope networks based on multivariate multilevel model. Thirty symptoms assessed by The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale clustered the networks. Five stable communities were detected in cross-sectional networks and random slope networks that describe symptoms change over time. Delusions, emotional withdrawal, and lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation featured as central symptoms, and conceptual disorganization, hostility, uncooperativeness, and difficulty in abstract thinking featured as bridge symptoms, all showing high centrality in the random slope network. Acute antipsychotic treatment changed the network structure (M-test = 0.116, P < .001) compared to baseline, and responsive subjects showed lower global strength after treatment (11.68 vs 14.18, S-test = 2.503, P < .001) compared to resistant subjects. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms kept higher centrality across random slope networks of different antipsychotics. Quetiapine treatment network showed improvement in excitement symptoms, the one featured as both central and bridge symptom.

36287604,A Smartphone App to Promote Patient Activation and Support Shared Decision-making in People With a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia in Outpatient Treatment Settings (Momentum Trial): Randomized Controlled Assessor-Blinded Trial.,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process aimed at facilitating patient-centered care by ensuring that the patient and provider are actively involved in treatment decisions. In mental health care, SDM has been advocated as a means for the patient to gain or regain control and responsibility over their life and recovery process. To support the process of patient-centered care and SDM, digital tools may have advantages in terms of accessibility, structure, and reminders. In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to investigate the effect of a digital tool to support patient activation and SDM. The trial was designed as a randomized, assessor-blinded, 2-armed, parallel-group multicenter trial investigating the use of a digital SDM intervention for 6 months compared with treatment as usual. Participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder were recruited from 9 outpatient treatment sites in the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome was the self-reported level of activation at the postintervention time point. The secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, hope, working alliance, satisfaction, preparedness for treatment consultation, symptom severity, and level of functioning. Explorative outcomes on the effect of the intervention at the midintervention time point along with objective data on the use of the digital tool were collected. In total, 194 participants were included. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a statistically significant effect favoring the intervention group on patient activation (mean difference 4.39, 95% CI 0.99-7.79; Cohen d=0.33; P=.01), confidence in communicating with one's provider (mean difference 1.85, 95% CI 0.01-3.69; Cohen d=0.24; P=.05), and feeling prepared for decision-making (mean difference 5.12, 95% CI 0.16-10.08; Cohen d=0.27; P=.04). We found no effect of the digital SDM tool on treatment satisfaction, hope, self-efficacy, working alliance, severity of symptoms, level of functioning, use of antipsychotic medicine, and number or length of psychiatric hospital admissions. This trial showed a significant effect of a digital SDM tool on the subjective level of patient activation, confidence in communicating with one's provider, and feeling prepared for decision-making at the postintervention time point.

This study examined AO in children with autism and anxiety by evaluating clinical characteristics, family accommodation, and changes in AO following anxiety-focused treatment. The sample comprised 167 youth with autism and anxiety enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial comparing standard care CBT for anxiety, CBT adapted for youth with autism, and usual care. Most participants (60%) had AO, which contributed to impairment above and beyond anxiety and autism. AO impacted functional impairment indirectly through a pathway of parental accommodation. AO reduced with anxiety-focused treatment.

However, gender differences in the outcomes of such treatment have not been studied in a randomized clinical trial. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with less than 6 months antipsychotic exposure entered a cluster randomized trial of early intervention services compared to usual care in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) study. Masked evaluators assessed the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) every 6 months. Our secondary analyses examined gender differences in baseline characteristics, 2-year gender outcomes, and intervention responses. Altogether 404 individuals aged 15-40 entered the study: 111 (27.4%) women and 293 (72.5%) men. At baseline, women were significantly more likely to have been married (p = .007) and to be living independently (p = .012) than men. Women were also more likely to be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (p = .006) and scored higher on the depression subscale of the PANSS (p = .0004) but not the CDSS. Women were less likely to use or abuse cannabis (p = .0004), though no less likely to abuse alcohol. Controlling for these differences, there were no significant gender differences in the QLS or PANSS outcomes.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (Deep TMS) targeting the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) using the H1 coil was FDA cleared for treatment of MDD. However, recent preliminary data indicate that targeting the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) using the H7 coil might induce outcomes that are as good or even better. Here, we explored whether Deep TMS targeting the MPFC is noninferior to targeting the LPFC and whether electrophysiological or clinical markers for patient selection can be identified.METHODSThe present prospective, multicenter, randomized study enrolled 169 patients with MDD for whom antidepressants failed in the current episode.

36735287,Effectiveness of Self-guided Tailored Implementation Strategies in Integrating and Embedding Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Routine Mental Health Care: Results of a Multicenter Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial.,"Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) services for common mental health disorders have been found to be effective. There is a need for strategies that improve implementation in routine practice. One-size-fits-all strategies are likely to be ineffective. Tailored implementation is considered as a promising approach. The self-guided integrated theory-based Framework for intervention tailoring strategies toolkit (ItFits-toolkit) supports local implementers in developing tailored implementation strategies. Tailoring involves identifying local barriers; matching selected barriers to implementation strategies; developing an actionable work plan; and applying, monitoring, and adapting where necessary. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the ItFits-toolkit with implementation-as-usual (IAU) in implementing iCBT services in 12 routine mental health care organizations in 9 countries in Europe and Australia. A stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design with repeated measures was applied. The trial period lasted 30 months. The primary outcome was the normalization of iCBT delivery by service providers (therapists, referrers, IT developers, and administrators), which was measured with the Normalization Measure Development as a proxy for implementation success. A 3-level linear mixed-effects modeling was applied to estimate the effects. iCBT service uptake (referral and treatment completion rates) and implementation effort (hours) were used as secondary outcomes. The perceived satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire), usability (System Usability Scale), and impact of the ItFits-toolkit by implementers were used to assess the acceptability of the ItFits-toolkit. In total, 456 mental health service providers were included in this study. Compared with IAU, the ItFits-toolkit had a small positive statistically significant effect on normalization levels in service providers (mean 0.09, SD 0.04; P=.02; Cohen d=0.12). The uptake of iCBT by patients was similar to that of IAU. Implementers did not spend more time on implementation work when using the ItFits-toolkit and generally regarded the ItFits-toolkit as usable and were satisfied with it. The ItFits-toolkit performed better than the usual implementation activities in implementing iCBT services in routine practice. There is practical utility in the ItFits-toolkit for supporting implementers in developing and applying effective tailored implementation strategies. However, the effect on normalization levels among mental health service providers was small.

Two datasets were analyzed: (1) the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D; n = 1,008 MDD patients, randomized to escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine, and n = 336 healthy controls) and (2) a multi-site, open-label rTMS study (n = 196). The primary outcome measure was remission. Cardiac field artifacts were removed from the baseline EEG using independent component analysis (ICA).

This multicenter, 8-week, open-label, randomized trial was conducted at 19 psychiatric centers throughout China. All enrolled participants were assigned to olanzapine, risperidone, amisulpride, or aripiprazole monotherapy for 8 weeks. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) was evaluated at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8. The main outcome was the prediction of nonresponse. Nonresponse is defined as a < 20% reduction in the total scores of PANSS from baseline to endpoint. Severity ratings of mild, moderate, and severe illness corresponded to baseline PANSS total scores of 58, 75, and 95, respectively. At week 2, a reduction of < 5% in the PANSS total score showed the highest total accuracy in the severe and mild schizophrenia patients (total accuracy, 75.0% and 80.8%, respectively), and patients who were treated with the risperidone and amisulpride groups (total accuracy, 82.4%, and 78.2%, respectively).

The study sites were all participating emergency departments, medical wards of general hospitals and primary care centres in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and Quetta, Pakistan. Patients presenting after a self-harm episode (n = 901) to participating recruitment sites were assessed and randomised (1:1) to one of the two arms; CMAP with enhanced treatment as usual (E-TAU) or E-TAU. The intervention (CMAP) is a manual-assisted, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)-informed problem-focused therapy, comprising six one-to-one sessions delivered over three months. Repetition of self-harm at 12-month post-randomisation was the primary outcome and secondary outcomes included suicidal ideation, hopelessness, depression, health-related quality of life (QoL), coping resources, and level of satisfaction with service received, assessed at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month post-randomisation.

The effect was sustained at 12-month follow-up for all the outcomes except for suicidal ideation and hopelessness. On suicidal ideation and hopelessness, participants in the intervention arm scored lower compared to the E-TAU arm but the difference was not statistically significant, though the participants in both arms were in low-risk category at 12-month follow-up. The improvement in both arms is explained by the established role of enhanced care in suicide prevention.

37530824,Duration of Adjunctive Antidepressant Maintenance in Bipolar I Depression.,"Antidepressants are used to treat acute depression in patients with bipolar I disorder, but their effect as maintenance treatment after the remission of depression has not been well studied. We conducted a multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maintenance of treatment with adjunctive escitalopram or bupropion XL as compared with discontinuation of antidepressant therapy in patients with bipolar I disorder who had recently had remission of a depressive episode. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue treatment with antidepressants for 52 weeks after remission or to switch to placebo at 8 weeks. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was any mood episode, as defined by scores on scales measuring symptoms of hypomania or mania, depression, suicidality, and mood-episode severity; additional treatment or hospitalization for mood symptoms; or attempted or completed suicide. Key secondary outcomes included the time to an episode of mania or hypomania or depression. Of 209 patients with bipolar I disorder who participated in an open-label treatment phase, 150 who had remission of depression were enrolled in the double-blind phase in addition to 27 patients who were enrolled directly. A total of 90 patients were assigned to continue treatment with the prescribed antidepressant for 52 weeks (52-week group) and 87 were assigned to switch to placebo at 8 weeks (8-week group). The trial was stopped before full recruitment was reached owing to slow recruitment and funding limitations.

We conducted a multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maintenance of treatment with adjunctive escitalopram or bupropion XL as compared with discontinuation of antidepressant therapy in patients with bipolar I disorder who had recently had remission of a depressive episode. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue treatment with antidepressants for 52 weeks after remission or to switch to placebo at 8 weeks. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was any mood episode, as defined by scores on scales measuring symptoms of hypomania or mania, depression, suicidality, and mood-episode severity; additional treatment or hospitalization for mood symptoms; or attempted or completed suicide. Key secondary outcomes included the time to an episode of mania or hypomania or depression. Of 209 patients with bipolar I disorder who participated in an open-label treatment phase, 150 who had remission of depression were enrolled in the double-blind phase in addition to 27 patients who were enrolled directly.

Here, we examined whether the effects of a digital intervention to treat depression in patients with CBP are mediated by three pain-related variables (i.e., pain self-efficacy, pain-related disability, pain intensity). This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted in routine care at 82 orthopedic clinics across Germany. In total, 209 adults with CBP and diagnosed depression (SCID interview) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 104) or treatment-as-usual (n = 105).

This multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 hospital-based bariatric surgery programs, with recruitment between February 2018 and December 2021. Eligibility for participation was assessed among 314 adults at 1 year after bariatric surgery who were fluent in English and had access to a telephone and the internet. Patients with active suicidal ideation or poorly controlled severe psychiatric illness were excluded. Primary and secondary outcome measures were assessed at baseline (1 year after surgery), after the intervention (approximately 15 months after surgery), and at 3-month follow-up (approximately 18 months after surgery). Data were analyzed from January to February 2023. The tele-CBT intervention consisted of 6 weekly 1-hour sessions and a seventh booster session 1 month later. The control group received standard postoperative bariatric care. The primary outcome was postoperative percentage total weight loss. Secondary outcomes were disordered eating (Binge Eating Scale [BES] and Emotional Eating Scale [EES]) and psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item scale [PHQ-9] and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale [GAD-7]).

Secondary outcomes included neuropathic symptoms (NPSI), pain interference, patient global impression of change (PGIC), anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing. In total, 51 patients participated in at least one session of both treatments. There was a significant interaction between ""treatment"" and ""time"" (F = 2.7; P = 0.0024), indicating that both figure-8 (F8-coil) and H-coil active stimulation induced significantly higher analgesic effects than sham stimulation. The analgesic effects of both types of coils had a similar magnitude but were only moderately correlated ( r = 0.39, P = 0.02). The effects of F8-coil stimulation appeared earlier, whereas the effects of H-coil stimulation were delayed, but tended to last longer (up to 3 weeks) as regards to several secondary outcomes (PGIC and total NPSI score). In conclusion, ""deep"" and ""superficial"" rTMS induced analgesic effects of similar magnitude in patients with central pain, which may involve different mechanisms of action.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant

38166851,A cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of two school-based interventions for autistic youth with anxiety.,"Recent systematic reviews have indicated that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for autistic and non-autistic children. However, the vast majority of CBT research for autistic youth has been implemented within university settings and primarily by mental health providers. Schools hold great promise to equitably manage the mental health symptoms of autistic youth. Although preliminary research evaluating CBT within schools has been promising, CBT has not yet been compared to another readily available school mental health program. The goal of this protocol paper is to describe a multi-site study comparing two school-based interventions, Facing Your Fears-School Based (FYF-SB) and Zones of Regulation (ZOR) via a cluster randomized controlled type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to determine which of the two interventions will best support autistic youth with anxiety in schools. Up to 100 elementary and middle schools will be randomized into FYF-SB or ZOR. Once schools are randomized, a minimum of two interdisciplinary school providers at each school will be trained to deliver either FYF-SB or ZOR over the course of 12 weeks to groups of 2-5 autistic students ages 8-14 years. Over the course of two years, a total of 200 autistic students will receive either ZOR or FYF-SB. The primary outcome of this trial is child anxiety, as rated by masked evaluators and via caregiver- and student-report, which will be measured at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with a purposive sample of students, caregivers, and school providers to understand the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of either ZOR or FYF-SB. Stakeholder engagement is a central component of this project via two stakeholder advisory boards that will directly inform and oversee the project. Results of this study will provide evidence about the relative impact of two school-based mental health interventions on outcomes reported as meaningful by caregivers and school providers.

38190077,Factors Associated with Symptom Stabilization that Allow for Successful Transition from Once-Monthly Paliperidone Palmitate to Three-Monthly Paliperidone Palmitate: A Post Hoc Analysis Examined Clinical Characteristics in Chinese Patients with Schizophrenia.,"Identifying key factors for a successful transition from once-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP1M) to three-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP3M) is crucial for improving treatment outcomes, enhancing patient adherence, and reducing relapse risk in patients with schizophrenia. Providing region-specific insights for evidence-based clinical decisions can aid clinicians in optimizing transition strategies for Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, the objective of this post hoc analysis of a double-blind parallel-group multicenter phase 3 study (NCT01515423) was to identify factors related to the disease stabilization that may allow for a successful transition from PP1M to PP3M in the treatment of Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Adults (18-70 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition text revision, for over 1 year and with a baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score between 70 and 120 were entered into an open-label (OL) phase receiving PP1M for 17 weeks. After the 17-week OL phase, patients who met the criteria necessary for stabilization were randomized (1:1) to PP1M (fixed-dose, 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq.) or PP3M (fixed-dose, 175, 263, 350, or 525 mg eq.) in a 48-week double-blind phase. Stabilization was defined as a PANSS total score < 70, PANSS item (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8, G14) scores ≤ 4, and a reduction in Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥ 1 from OL baseline. This post hoc analysis evaluated changes and trends in symptom severity using PANSS, changes in mental states using CGI-S, and changes in personal and social functioning using Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scores from baseline to the endpoint of the OL phase in patients who either met or did not meet the stabilization criteria (stabilized versus non-stabilized group). Comparison of changes and trends in the clinical scores between the stabilized group and non-stabilized group were conducted using linear mixed model and Mann-Kendall trend analysis, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore factors associated with stabilization status for transition. Of 296 patients enrolled, 210 achieved disease stabilization (106 patients and 104 patients were randomized to PP1M and PP3M, respectively). Significant downward trends in the PANSS and CGI-S scores were detected in the stabilized patients (n = 210, Z = -2.21, p = 0.028; Z = -2.21, p = 0.028) but not in the non-stabilized patients (n = 86). No significant trends in the PSP scores were observed in either group. The factors significantly associated with disease stabilization were the CGI-S score at baseline [odds ratio (OR) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09, 0.5), reduction of the PANSS score at week 13 (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.17), and reduction of CGI-S score at week 13 (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.03, 5.02). A lower CGI-S total score at baseline and greater reductions in PANSS and CGI-S scores at week 13 were associated with patients achieving disease stabilization, that may allow for a successful transition. Evidence from this study indicates that better disease condition at baseline, early functional improvement and symptomatic relief were the key factors associated with disease stabilization. The findings may guide clinicians to identify suitable patients for transition from PP1M to PP3M and further optimize the use of PP3M in China.

Providing region-specific insights for evidence-based clinical decisions can aid clinicians in optimizing transition strategies for Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, the objective of this post hoc analysis of a double-blind parallel-group multicenter phase 3 study (NCT01515423) was to identify factors related to the disease stabilization that may allow for a successful transition from PP1M to PP3M in the treatment of Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Adults (18-70 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition text revision, for over 1 year and with a baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score between 70 and 120 were entered into an open-label (OL) phase receiving PP1M for 17 weeks. After the 17-week OL phase, patients who met the criteria necessary for stabilization were randomized (1:1) to PP1M (fixed-dose, 50, 75, 100, or 150 mg eq.) or PP3M (fixed-dose, 175, 263, 350, or 525 mg eq.) in a 48-week double-blind phase. Stabilization was defined as a PANSS total score < 70, PANSS item (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8, G14) scores ≤ 4, and a reduction in Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥ 1 from OL baseline.

Noninvasive brain stimulation has shown promise in the treatment of schizophrenia but has not been tested specifically for apathy. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeted at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder suffering from apathy. The study was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, and rater-blinded trial. Patients (N = 88) were randomized into active iTBS, active tDCS, sham iTBS or sham tDCS treatment, daily for two weeks (excluding weekends). Effects were measured post-treatment and at four week and ten week follow-up. Primary outcome was apathy severity (Apathy Evaluation Scale, clinician-rated). Additional measures included assessment of negative symptoms, depression, anhedonia and quality of life. No significant difference in improvement of apathy or negative symptoms was observed for real versus sham treatment with either iTBS or tDCS, though all groups improved to a small extent.

The authors sought to determine whether a multimodal machine learning approach could predict early sertraline response in patients with major depressive disorder. They assessed the predictive contribution of MR neuroimaging and clinical assessments at baseline and after 1 week of treatment. This was a preregistered secondary analysis of data from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, a multisite double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that included 296 adult outpatients with unmedicated recurrent or chronic major depressive disorder. MR neuroimaging and clinical data were collected before and after 1 week of treatment. Performance in predicting response and remission, collected after 8 weeks, was quantified using balanced accuracy (bAcc) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores. A total of 229 patients were included in the analyses (mean age, 38 years [SD=13]; 66% female). Internal cross-validation performance in predicting response to sertraline (bAcc=68% [SD=10], AUROC=0.73 [SD=0.03]) was significantly better than chance. External cross-validation on data from placebo nonresponders (bAcc=62%, AUROC=0.66) and placebo nonresponders who were switched to sertraline (bAcc=65%, AUROC=0.68) resulted in differences that suggest specificity for sertraline treatment compared with placebo treatment. Finally, multimodal models outperformed unimodal models. The study results confirm that early sertraline treatment response can be predicted; that the models are sertraline specific compared with placebo; that prediction benefits from integrating multimodal MRI data with clinical data; and that perfusion imaging contributes most to these predictions.

Digitally augmented psychological therapies bring potential to increase availability of effective help for children with mental health problems. This study aimed to establish whether therapist-supported, digitally augmented, parent-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could increase the efficiency of treatment without compromising clinical effectiveness and acceptability. We conducted a pragmatic, unblinded, two-arm, multisite, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapist-supported, parent-led CBT using the Online Support and Intervention (OSI) for child anxiety platform compared with treatment as usual for child (aged 5-12 years) anxiety problems in 34 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in England and Northern Ireland. We examined acceptability of OSI plus therapist support via qualitative interviews. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to OSI plus therapist support or treatment as usual, minimised by child age, gender, service type, and baseline child anxiety interference. Outcomes were assessed at week 14 and week 26 after randomisation. The primary clinical outcome was parent-reported interference caused by child anxiety at week 26 assessment, using the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-parent report (CAIS-P). The primary measure of health economic effect was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Outcome analyses were conducted blind in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with a standardised non-inferiority margin of 0·33 for clinical analyses. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, 12890382. Between Dec 5, 2020, and Aug 3, 2022, 706 families (706 children and their parents or carers) were referred to the study information. 444 families were enrolled. Parents reported 255 (58%) child participants' gender to be female, 184 (41%) male, three (<1%) other, and one (<1%) preferred not to report their child's gender. 400 (90%) children were White and the mean age was 9·20 years (SD 1·79). 85% of families for whom clinicians provided information in the treatment as usual group received CBT. OSI plus therapist support was non-inferior for parent-reported anxiety interference on the CAIS-P (SMD 0·01, 95% CI -0·15 to 0·17; p<0·0001) and all secondary outcomes. The mean difference in QALYs across trial arms approximated to zero, and OSI plus therapist support was associated with lower costs than treatment as usual.

In this multi-site, 8-week, randomized, open-label study, 278 subjects (196 females and 82 males, mean age 45.6 years (SD 15.3)) with treatment-resistant depression were assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to treatment with either of these three interventions; 235 subjects completed the study. 260 randomized subjects with at least one post-baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating (MADRS) assessment were included in the analysis. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (score change (standard error (se)) = -17.39 (1.3) (p = 0.015) but not aripiprazole augmentation (score change (se) = -14.9 (1.1) (p = 0.069) was superior to switch (score change (se) = -13.22 (1.1)) on the MADRS. Aripiprazole (mean change (se) = -37.79 (2.9) (p = 0.003) but not repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation augmentation (mean change (se) = -42.96 (3.6) (p = 0.031) was superior to switch (mean change (se) = -34.45 (3.0)) on the symptoms of depression questionnaire. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation augmentation was shown to be more effective than switching antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression on the study primary measure. In light of these findings, clinicians should consider repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation augmentation early-on for treatment-resistant depression.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02977299.",True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,compliant

To assess the association of physical diseases and PPH with the outcomes of 2 different types of psychotherapy in LLD. This post hoc secondary analysis of a multicenter, observer-blinded, controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial assessed participants 60 years or older with moderate to severe depression recruited at 7 psychiatric-psychotherapeutic outpatient trial sites in Germany from October 1, 2018, to November 11, 2020. Data analysis was performed from April 1 to October 31, 2023. Patients received LLD-specific cognitive behavioral therapy (LLD-CBT) or supportive unspecific intervention (SUI). Depression severity, response, and remission were measured during treatment and at 6-month follow-up by the change in the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score. Physical health and PPH were assessed by the number of physical diseases, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version physical health subscale.

In prior trials, xanomeline-trospium chloride was effective in reducing symptoms of psychosis and generally well tolerated in people with schizophrenia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of xanomeline-trospium vs placebo in adults with schizophrenia. EMERGENT-3 (NCT04738123) was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-week trial of xanomeline-trospium in people with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis, conducted between April 1, 2021, and December 7, 2022, at 30 inpatient sites in the US and Ukraine. Data were analyzed from February to June 2023. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive xanomeline-trospium chloride (maximum dose xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg) or placebo for 5 weeks. The prespecified primary end point was change from baseline to week 5 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. Secondary outcome measures were change from baseline to week 5 in PANSS positive subscale score, PANSS negative subscale score, PANSS Marder negative factor score, Clinical Global Impression-Severity score, and proportion of participants with at least a 30% reduction in PANSS total score.

Discontinuation rates due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the xanomeline-trospium (8 participants [6.4%]) and placebo (7 participants [5.5%]) groups. The most common TEAEs in the xanomeline-trospium vs placebo group were nausea (24 participants [19.2%] vs 2 participants [1.6%]), dyspepsia (20 participants [16.0%] vs 2 participants [1.6%]), vomiting (20 participants [16.0%] vs 1 participant [0.8%]), and constipation (16 participants [12.8%] vs 5 participants [3.9%]). Measures of extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and somnolence were similar between treatment groups. Xanomeline-trospium was efficacious and well tolerated in people with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis. These findings, together with the previously reported and consistent results from the EMERGENT-1 and EMERGENT-2 trials, support the potential of xanomeline-trospium to be the first in a putative new class of antipsychotic medications without D2 dopamine receptor blocking activity.

38754101,Economic Evaluation of a Web Application Implemented in Primary Care for the Treatment of Depression in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Depressive disorder and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are prevalent in primary care (PC). Pharmacological treatment, despite controversy, is commonly chosen due to resource limitations and difficulties in accessing face-to-face interventions. Depression significantly impacts various aspects of a person's life, affecting adherence to medical prescriptions and glycemic control and leading to future complications and increased health care costs. To address these challenges, information and communication technologies (eg, eHealth) have been introduced, showing promise in improving treatment continuity and accessibility. However, while eHealth programs have demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms, evidence regarding glycemic control remains inconclusive. This randomized controlled trial aimed to test the efficacy of a low-intensity psychological intervention via a web app for mild-moderate depressive symptoms in individuals with T2DM compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in PC. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a web-based psychological intervention to treat depressive symptomatology in people with T2DM compared with TAU in a PC setting. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 patients with T2DM, depressive symptoms of moderate severity, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA) of 7.47% in PC settings. Patients were randomized to TAU (n=27) or a web-based psychological treatment group (n=22). This web-based treatment consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, improvement of diabetes self-care behaviors, and mindfulness. Cost-effectiveness analysis for the improvement of depressive symptomatology was conducted based on reductions in 3, 5, or 50 points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The efficacy of diabetes control was estimated based on a 0.5% reduction in HbA levels. Follow-up was performed at 3 and 6 months. The cost-utility analysis was performed based on quality-adjusted life years. Efficacy analysis showed that the web-based treatment program was more effective in improving depressive symptoms than TAU but showed only a slight improvement in HbA. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 186.76 for a 3-point reduction in PHQ-9 and 206.31 for reductions of 5 and 50 percentage points were obtained. In contrast, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for improving HbA levels amounted to €1510.90 (€1=US $1.18 in 2018) per participant. The incremental cost-utility ratio resulted in €4119.33 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The intervention, using web-based modules incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy tools, diabetes self-care promotion, and mindfulness, effectively reduced depressive symptoms and enhanced glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Notably, it demonstrated clinical efficacy and economic efficiency. This supports the idea that eHealth interventions not only benefit patients clinically but also offer cost-effectiveness for health care systems. The study emphasizes the importance of including specific modules to enhance diabetes self-care behaviors in future web-based psychological interventions, emphasizing personalization and adaptation for this population.

38770645,Adherence Rates and Barriers to Second-Generation Antipsychotic Medication Use in Youth with Bipolar Spectrum Disorders Who Have Overweight/Obesity.,"Youth with bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD) are frequently prescribed second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). Nonadherence to treatment often results in increased mood symptoms and diminished quality of life. We examined SGA adherence rates and adherence barriers among youth who have overweight/obesity and are diagnosed with BSD enrolled in a multisite pragmatic clinical trial.  SGA adherence and adherence barriers at baseline via patient- and caregiver report was assessed. Adherence was defined as taking ≥70% of prescribed SGA doses in the past week. The weighted Kappa statistic was used to measure child-caregiver agreement about adherence rates, barriers, and caregiver assistance. Regression analyses were used to examine associations of caregiver assistance, age, sex, race, insurance status, dosing frequency, and number of concomitant medications with adherence. Barriers to adherence were analyzed separately for youth and their caregivers, using logistic regression to assess associations between informant-reported barriers and informant-reported adherence.  Participants included 1485 patients and/or caregivers. At baseline, 88.6% of patients self-reported as adherent; 92.0% of caregivers reported their child was adherent. Concordance between patients and caregivers was moderate ( = 0.42). Approximately, 50% of the sample reported no adherence barriers. Frequently endorsed barriers included forgetting, side effects, being embarrassed to take medications, and preferring to do something else. Concordance between informants regarding adherence barriers was weak ( = 0.05-0.36). Patients and caregivers who did not endorse adherence barriers reported higher adherence than those who endorsed barriers.

Data were drawn from two multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating effectiveness of MBCT vs treatment as usual (TAU; n = 144) and PPI vs TAU (n = 97) in bipolar disorder. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 12 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using separate linear regression models, comparing the pooled MBCT or PPI outcomes to TAU, and comparing MBCT to PPI. The exploratory analyses not corrected for multiple comparisons showed a number of variables that were associated with stronger response to the interventions, including higher baseline anxiety, lower well-being, and lower levels of self-focused positive rumination, well-being, and self-compassion, and variables associated with a stronger response to either MBCT (higher levels of depression and anxiety and being married) or PPI (being male). After correcting for multiple testing, depressive symptoms appeared to be the most robust variable associated with better response to MBCT than PPI.

We evaluated the PDE10A inhibitor MK-8189 for treating schizophrenia. Randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, phase 2a, multicenter, inpatient trial in adults experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia. Participants were randomized 2:2:1 to once-daily MK-8189 12 mg, placebo, or risperidone 6 mg (active control) for 4-weeks. The primary outcome was change-from-baseline in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at 4 weeks. The number of treated participants was 90 for MK-8189, 89 for placebo, and 45 for risperidone. MK-8189 demonstrated a trend towards improvement versus placebo for change-from-baseline in PANSS total score after 4 weeks (difference = -4.7 [95 % CI: -9.8,0.5], P = 0.074). The active control risperidone was superior to placebo on PANNS total score (difference = -7.3 [95 % CI: -14.0,-0.6], P = 0.033), demonstrating assay sensitivity, while MK-8189 and risperidone did not significantly differ (difference = 2.6 [95 % CI: -4.0,9.2], P = 0.440).

The active control risperidone was superior to placebo on PANNS total score (difference = -7.3 [95 % CI: -14.0,-0.6], P = 0.033), demonstrating assay sensitivity, while MK-8189 and risperidone did not significantly differ (difference = 2.6 [95 % CI: -4.0,9.2], P = 0.440). MK-8189 had a nominally significant effect on PANSS positive subscale score compared to placebo (difference = -2.2 [95 % CI: -3.8,-0.5], P = 0.011). Discontinuation of MK-8189 treatment due to an adverse event was low (<10 %). Extrapyramidal symptoms occurred with MK-8189 but were mostly mild and transient. Compared with placebo, MK-8189 reduced body weight while risperidone increased weight. These findings suggest that PDE10A inhibition may produce antipsychotic effects and associated weight loss and that further trials with PDE10A inhibitors are warranted.

However, the mechanisms through which cognitive behavior therapy impact HRQoL are not well understood. This study evaluated whether anxiety and depression symptom reduction is a mechanism of treatment for HRQoL outcomes. : Using secondary data from a multisite, pragmatic, randomized trial, this study evaluated bCBT vs enhanced usual care in 16 VA community-based outpatient clinics. Ordinary least-squares path analysis testing multiple mediators was used to evaluate the role of change in depression and anxiety symptoms in the relationship between treatment condition and HRQoL.

39120902,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Pain Management for Nonspecific Chronic Spinal Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Insomnia is highly prevalent in patients with nonspecific chronic spinal pain (nCSP). Given the close interaction between insomnia and pain, targeting sleep problems during therapy could improve treatment outcomes. To evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) integrated in best-evidence pain management (BEPM) vs BEPM only in patients with nCSP and insomnia. A multicenter randomized clinical trial with 1-year follow-up was conducted between April 10, 2018, and April 30, 2022. Data and statistical analysis were performed between May 1, 2022, and April 24, 2023. Patients with nCSP and insomnia were evaluated using self-report and at-home polysomnography, to exclude underlying sleep pathologic factors. Participants were treated at the University Hospital Brussels or University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Participants were randomized to either CBTi-BEPM or BEPM only. Both groups received 18 treatment sessions over 14 weeks. The CBTi-BEPM treatment included 6 CBTi sessions and 12 BEPM sessions. The BEPM treatment included pain neuroscience education (3 sessions) and exercise therapy (9 sessions in the CBTi-BEPM group, 15 sessions in the BEPM-only group). The primary outcome was change in mean pain intensity (assessed with Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]) at 12 months after the intervention. Exploratory secondary outcomes included several pain- and sleep-related outcomes. Blinded outcome assessment took place at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. A total of 123 patients (mean [SD] age, 40.2 [11.18] years; 84 women [68.3%]) were included in the trial. In 99 participants (80.5%) with 12-month BPI data, the mean pain intensity at 12 months decreased by 1.976 points (reduction of 40%) in the CBTi-BEPM group and 1.006 points (reduction of 24%) points in the BEPM-only group. At 12 months, there was no significant difference in pain intensity change between groups (mean group difference, 0.970 points; 95% CI, -0.051 to 1.992; Cohen d, 2.665). Treatment with CBTi-BEPM resulted in a response for BPI average pain with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4 observed during 12 months. On a preliminary basis, CBTi-BEPM was, consistently over time and analyses, more effective than BEPM only for improving insomnia severity (Cohen d, 4.319-8.961; NNT for response ranging from 2 to 4, and NNT for remission ranging from 5 to 12), sleep quality (Cohen d, 3.654-6.066), beliefs about sleep (Cohen d, 5.324-6.657), depressive symptoms (Cohen d, 2.935-3.361), and physical fatigue (Cohen d, 2.818-3.770). No serious adverse effects were reported. In this randomized clinical trial, adding CBTi to BEPM did not further improve pain intensity reduction for patients with nCSP and comorbid insomnia more than BEPM alone. Yet, as CBTi-BEPM led to significant and clinically important changes in insomnia severity and sleep quality, CBTi integrated in BEPM should be considered in the treatment of patients with nCSP and comorbid insomnia. Further research can investigate the patient characteristics that moderate the response to CBTi-BEPM in terms of pain-related outcomes, as understanding of these moderators may be of utmost clinical importance.

A multicenter randomized clinical trial with 1-year follow-up was conducted between April 10, 2018, and April 30, 2022. Data and statistical analysis were performed between May 1, 2022, and April 24, 2023. Patients with nCSP and insomnia were evaluated using self-report and at-home polysomnography, to exclude underlying sleep pathologic factors. Participants were treated at the University Hospital Brussels or University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Participants were randomized to either CBTi-BEPM or BEPM only. Both groups received 18 treatment sessions over 14 weeks. The CBTi-BEPM treatment included 6 CBTi sessions and 12 BEPM sessions. The BEPM treatment included pain neuroscience education (3 sessions) and exercise therapy (9 sessions in the CBTi-BEPM group, 15 sessions in the BEPM-only group). The primary outcome was change in mean pain intensity (assessed with Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]) at 12 months after the intervention. Exploratory secondary outcomes included several pain- and sleep-related outcomes. Blinded outcome assessment took place at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. A total of 123 patients (mean [SD] age, 40.2 [11.18] years; 84 women [68.3%]) were included in the trial. In 99 participants (80.5%) with 12-month BPI data, the mean pain intensity at 12 months decreased by 1.976 points (reduction of 40%) in the CBTi-BEPM group and 1.006 points (reduction of 24%) points in the BEPM-only group. At 12 months, there was no significant difference in pain intensity change between groups (mean group difference, 0.970 points; 95% CI, -0.051 to 1.992; Cohen d, 2.665). Treatment with CBTi-BEPM resulted in a response for BPI average pain with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4 observed during 12 months. On a preliminary basis, CBTi-BEPM was, consistently over time and analyses, more effective than BEPM only for improving insomnia severity (Cohen d, 4.319-8.961; NNT for response ranging from 2 to 4, and NNT for remission ranging from 5 to 12), sleep quality (Cohen d, 3.654-6.066), beliefs about sleep (Cohen d, 5.324-6.657), depressive symptoms (Cohen d, 2.935-3.361), and physical fatigue (Cohen d, 2.818-3.770). No serious adverse effects were reported. In this randomized clinical trial, adding CBTi to BEPM did not further improve pain intensity reduction for patients with nCSP and comorbid insomnia more than BEPM alone. Yet, as CBTi-BEPM led to significant and clinically important changes in insomnia severity and sleep quality, CBTi integrated in BEPM should be considered in the treatment of patients with nCSP and comorbid insomnia. Further research can investigate the patient characteristics that moderate the response to CBTi-BEPM in terms of pain-related outcomes, as understanding of these moderators may be of utmost clinical importance.

The estimated mean posttreatment TAAS score was significantly higher in the I-CBT group than in the CBT group. While both CBT and I-CBT are effective for OCD, whether I-CBT is non-inferior to CBT in terms of OCD symptom severity remains inconclusive. Nevertheless, I-CBT offers better tolerability and warrants consideration as an alternative treatment for OCD.",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,noncompliant
39535125,Grief-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs Present-Centered Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is included as a new diagnosis in international classification systems. Treatments following a cognitive behavioral model are most effective, but comparisons with active control treatments are scarce. To examine whether integrative cognitive behavioral therapy for prolonged grief (PG-CBT) is superior to present-centered therapy (PCT). This was a rater-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (stratified by center and relationship to the deceased) with enrollment from April 2017 to May 2022. The setting included 4 university outpatient clinics in Germany. Eligible participants were aged 18 to 75 years and had PGD based on the Prolonged Grief Disorder 13 (PG-13) interview. Participants were randomized 1:1 to PG-CBT and PCT. PG-CBT focused on the exposure to the worst moment of the loss and cognitive restructuring of grief-related cognitions in combination with solution-focused and experiential methods (eg, walk to the grave exercise). PCT was adapted in session length and number to PG-CBT and focused on a supportive relationship and coping with daily problems that may have arisen from the loss or grief symptoms. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and 12 months after randomization at follow-up. The primary outcome was a blinded assessment of the PG-13 severity score at follow-up. Secondary outcomes were self-reported depressive, somatic, and overall psychopathological symptoms. Of 544 treatment-seeking individuals experiencing bereavement, 212 eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 51.8 [13.3] years; 173 female [82%]) with PGD based on the PG-13 interview were randomized to PG-CBT and PCT (n = 106 in each condition). In the intention-to-treat analysis, both treatments yielded high reductions in PGD severity at follow-up (PG-CBT: Cohen d = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.31-1.97; PCT: Cohen d = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.66). After treatment, participants receiving PG-CBT demonstrated significantly greater reductions in PGD severity than those receiving PCT (Cohen d = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.03-0.57). At follow-up, this effect was only visible on a trend level (Cohen d = 0.28; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.57), whereas participants in the PG-CBT group had significantly less depressive and general psychopathological symptoms. Twenty-three participants (20%) discontinued PG-CBT treatment, and 17 participants (16%) discontinued PCT.

Participants were screened for antenatal depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and randomly allocated (1:1) to either the ICBT group (receiving weekly online modules starting antenatally and continuing into early postpartum) or the control group (observed without treatment). Follow-up assessments were conducted up to 12 months postpartum, and data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. The primary outcome was the prevalence of depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum. A subgroup analysis based on the severity of antenatal depressive symptoms was also performed. The secondary outcomes included the long-term effects of ICBT on maternal depression, as well as its impact on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, parenting stress, co-parenting relationships, and infant development. Between August 2020 and September 2021, 300 pregnant individuals were recruited from 5 centers across China. No significant differences were observed in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum (P=.18) or at any longer-term follow-up time points (P=.18).

To assess whether neuroimaging and clinical features predict response to sertraline and escitalopram in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) across 2 multisite studies using machine learning and to predict change in depression severity in 2 independent studies. This prognostic study included structural and functional resting-state magnetic resonance imaging and clinical and demographic data from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) randomized clinical trial (RCT), which administered sertraline (in stage 1 and stage 2) and placebo, and the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CANBIND-1) RCT, which administered escitalopram. EMBARC recruited participants with MDD (aged 18-65 years) at 4 academic sites across the US between August 2011 and December 2015.

Clozapine, the most efficacious antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is associated with weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide, contribute to substantial weight loss in the general population, but their effect and safety profile in people with schizophrenia remain unknown. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide for weight reduction in individuals with schizophrenia who were prescribed clozapine. COaST was an Australian randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-site trial, independent of pharmaceutical industry support, with methods informed by people with lived experience. Adults (aged 18-64 years) across six sites were randomly assigned (1:1) to once weekly subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2·0 mg or placebo for 36 weeks. Participants were included if they fulfilled criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, were prescribed clozapine for 18 weeks or more, had a BMI of at least 26 kg/m, and had less than 5% bodyweight increase or loss in the previous 3 months. The primary outcome was percentage body weight change, analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures, at 36 weeks post-baseline assessment. All investigators and participants were masked to medication allocation. Secondary measures included clozapine and norclozapine concentrations and psychosis symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Psychiatry,"Efficacy and safety of semaglutide versus placebo for people with schizophrenia on clozapine with obesity (COaST): a phase 2, multi-centre, participant and investigator- blinded, randomised controlled trial in Australia.","People with schizophrenia have a 16-20-year reduction in life expectancy, primarily due to cardiometabolic disease. Clozapine, the most efficacious antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, is associated with weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide, contribute to substantial weight loss in the general population, but their effect and safety profile in people with schizophrenia remain unknown. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide for weight reduction in individuals with schizophrenia who were prescribed clozapine. COaST was an Australian randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-site trial, independent of pharmaceutical industry support, with methods informed by people with lived experience. Adults (aged 18-64 years) across six sites were randomly assigned (1:1) to once weekly subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2·0 mg or placebo for 36 weeks. Participants were included if they fulfilled criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, were prescribed clozapine for 18 weeks or more, had a BMI of at least 26 kg/m, and had less than 5% bodyweight increase or loss in the previous 3 months. The primary outcome was percentage body weight change, analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures, at 36 weeks post-baseline assessment. All investigators and participants were masked to medication allocation.

Suicide-specific cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is effective for reducing suicide attempts but is difficult to implement. To evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone-based digital therapeutic intervention designed to deliver suicide-focused CBT in reducing suicidal behavior among patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. This multisite, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 6 psychiatric inpatient units across the US. Adult patients admitted with elevated suicide risk from April 2022 to April 2024 were included. Participants completed a baseline assessment and were randomly assigned to either the digital therapeutic group or control application group. The trial was stopped early by the Data Management Safety Board because it surpassed the prespecified futility boundary for the primary end point. Statistical analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. The digital therapeutic intervention includes 12 sessions of smartphone-based educational modules (lasting 10-15 minutes each) drawn from CBT for suicide prevention. The active control is a 12-session smartphone-based application that delivers safety planning and psychoeducation about suicide. For both interventions, the first session was completed prior to hospital discharge and the remaining self-paced sessions could be completed after discharge. All participants also received treatment as usual, which included suicide risk assessment, supportive listening, crisis resources, clinician assessment, safety planning, and referral to outpatient treatment. The primary end point was time (days) to first actual suicide attempt during follow-up. The secondary end points were change in suicidal ideation from baseline to week 24 (quantified as a change in the Scale for Suicide Ideation total score) and clinician-rated clinical improvement at week 24. The nonprespecified sensitivity analysis end point for suicide attempts was the rate of suicide attempts (actual, aborted, and interrupted). Prespecified subgroup analyses were also conducted to examine treatment effects among patients with vs without prior suicide attempts. A total of 339 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.9 [10.7] years; 224 females [66.1%]) were included. Follow-up data were available from 266 participants (78.5%). Time to first actual suicide attempt, the primary end point, was not significantly different across treatment groups (log-rank χ21 = 3.6; P = .06). Among the 170 participants with prior suicide attempts, nonprespecified sensitivity analyses indicated that the adjusted rate of follow-up suicide attempts was 58.3% lower in the digital therapeutic group than the control application group (0.70 vs 1.68 attempts per person-year; rate ratio [RR], 0.42 [95% CI, 0.18-0.95]; P = .04), and the odds of clinical improvement were higher in the digital therapeutic group than the control application group (97.9% vs 87.5%; odds ratio, 7.59; 95% CI, 1.14-153.62; P = .04). Trajectories of suicidal ideation significantly differed between the digital therapeutic and control application groups (F3,206 = 2.9, P = .04), with decreased suicidal ideation through week 24 in the digital therapeutic group, but in the control application group, suicidal ideation decreased through week 12 and then increased at week 24.

Both active treatments resulted in significantly reduced scores on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (P = .04 and P = .01 for sertraline and imipramine vs placebo, respectively), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (P = .01 and P = .003 vs placebo, respectively), Hopkins Symptom Checklist (P < .05), and the self-rated version of the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (P < .05). With the use of a Clinical Global impressions improvement score of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) to define response, response rates were 59% for sertraline, 64% for imipramine, and 44% for placebo (P = .02 for sertraline vs placebo and P < .001 for imipramine vs placebo). A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving imipramine than those receiving sertraline or placebo discontinued treatment because of adverse events (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Pharmacotherapy provides considerable relief from the symptoms of dysthymia in patients suffering from this chronic affective disorder, with both sertraline and imipramine being more effective than placebo. The greater tolerability of sertraline is an important consideration because of the chronicity of dysthymia, which may require prolonged treatment with antidepressant medication.",True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,compliant

Cluster analysis applied to endpoint PANSS scores, including all patients (N = 135), identified three clusters representing 130 patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptomatology.

9871816,Comparison of the tolerability and efficacy of citalopram and amitriptyline in elderly depressed patients treated in general practice.,"The enhanced sensitivity of the elderly to the side effects produced by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and the frequency and type of adverse events, have made the treatment of depression in this group difficult. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to produce significantly fewer undesirable side effects and display better tolerance than TCAs. We compared the therapeutic actions and side effects produced by citalopram, the most selective SSRI available, with amitriptyline in a group of elderly patients (aged 65 and older) diagnosed with major depression. In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter comparison of citalopram (20 or 40 mg/day) and amitriptyline (50 or 100 mg/day), patients who did not respond to placebo during a 1-week single-blind phase were randomly assigned to receive citalopram or amitriptyline for 8 weeks. Efficacy measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Clinical Global Impressions. Both drug treatments produced equivalent time-related declines in severity of depression, so that by 8 weeks slightly more than 50% of the patients in each group experienced marked recovery, defined as MADRS scores < or = 12. Amitriptyline produced a greater overall incidence of adverse events, including a significantly higher (P < 0.001) percentage of patients reporting dry mouth (34% vs. 7%), as well as a significantly higher (P < 0.02) incidence of somnolence. Constipation and fatigue also occurred more frequently in the amitriptyline than in the citalopram group. For only one event (nausea) did the citalopram group report a significantly greater (P = 0.012) incidence (12.8% vs. 4.8%). On the basis of these results, it was concluded that citalopram is as effective an antidepressant as amitriptyline in the treatment of the depressed elderly. Because of its low incidence and low magnitude of side effects, citalopram seems especially useful in private practice.",Depression and anxiety,1998,,noncompliant,1990,1998,Depression and anxiety,Comparison of the tolerability and efficacy of citalopram and amitriptyline in elderly depressed patients treated in general practice.,"The enhanced sensitivity of the elderly to the side effects produced by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and the frequency and type of adverse events, have made the treatment of depression in this group difficult. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to produce significantly fewer undesirable side effects and display better tolerance than TCAs. We compared the therapeutic actions and side effects produced by citalopram, the most selective SSRI available, with amitriptyline in a group of elderly patients (aged 65 and older) diagnosed with major depression. In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicenter comparison of citalopram (20 or 40 mg/day) and amitriptyline (50 or 100 mg/day), patients who did not respond to placebo during a 1-week single-blind phase were randomly assigned to receive citalopram or amitriptyline for 8 weeks. Efficacy measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Clinical Global Impressions. Both drug treatments produced equivalent time-related declines in severity of depression, so that by 8 weeks slightly more than 50% of the patients in each group experienced marked recovery, defined as MADRS scores < or = 12.

9892301,Olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment in first-episode psychosis.,"It has been hypothesized that the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia can be prevented by providing effective treatment during the first episode of psychosis. Hence, the authors examined patients with first-episode psychosis to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and haloperidol treatment. A subpopulation of first-episode patients (N=83) from a large prospective, multicenter, international, double-blind, 6-week acute treatment study was evaluated. These patients were selected from a pool of 1,996 patients who had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder and who also met the following criteria: 1) the length of their current psychotic episode had to be 5 or fewer years, and 2) patients had to be 45 years of age or younger at onset of first psychotic symptoms. Compared to haloperidol, olanzapine showed a statistically significantly greater reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total and negative scores and in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and positive scores. Clinical response (defined as 40% or greater improvement in BPRS total score from baseline) was also statistically significantly higher in olanzapine-treated patients (67.2%) than in haloperidol-treated patients (29.2%). Olanzapine-treated patients further showed statistically significant improvements in the Simpson-Angus scale and Barnes Akathisia Scale scores, while haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on both measures. Compared to olanzapine-treated multiple-episode patients in the parent study, olanzapine-treated first-episode patients achieved an even statistically significantly higher response. Haloperidol-treated first-episode patients experienced statistically significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms than haloperidol-treated multiple-episode patients. In patients experiencing first-episode psychosis, olanzapine had a risk-benefit profile significantly superior to that of haloperidol. The study results suggest that novel antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine should be considered as a preferred option in first-episode psychosis, on the basis of both safety and efficacy advantages.",The American journal of psychiatry,1999,,noncompliant,1990,1999,The American journal of psychiatry,Olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment in first-episode psychosis.,"It has been hypothesized that the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia can be prevented by providing effective treatment during the first episode of psychosis.

9924649,Effectiveness of fluoxetine therapy in bulimia nervosa regardless of comorbid depression.,"To evaluate fluoxetine efficacy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa patients with or without comorbid depression. Two parallel, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled fluoxetine clinical trials were retrospectively analyzed to determine the effect of comorbid depression on bulimia treatment response. Patients were stratified by their 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD21) scores at baseline and by the presence or absence of historical or current depression. Change from baseline to endpoint in the number of binge eating and vomiting episodes was used to assess efficacy. Fluoxetine 60 mg treatment statistically significantly reduced (p < .05) the median number of binge eating and vomiting episodes. These improvements were independent of baseline HAMD21 score and of historical or current comorbid depression diagnosis.

Across five U.S. sites, 128 outpatients (mean age: 41.3 +/- 12.6; 63 men and 65 women) with moderate to moderately severe major depression without a history of mania or hypomania were recruited between 1993 and 1994. All 128 patients completed a 1-week placebo washout period, and were then randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with paroxetine up to 50 mg/day (n = 55), fluoxetine up to 80 mg/day (n = 54), or placebo (n = 19). Subjects were evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks, then at weeks 6, 9, and 12 with the 21-item HAMD and the Covi Anxiety Scale. There were no significant differences among the three treatment groups in baseline and endpoint depression and anxiety severity, as well as in the degree of depression and anxiety improvement.
